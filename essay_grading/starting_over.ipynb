their children that should take some classes like music, drama, or an art class instead of elective classes. But another parents they do not believe and force them to take those classes. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes.\n","\n","In general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. Here are some reasons that is showed why they have to take those classes; like music, a drama, or an art class. First reason is if they took those classes, they can decrease their stress that they have in their life and their school. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Third reason is, if they really learned from those classes, they can teach to another persons and get money for that. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school.\n","\n","First, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require to take those classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. for example, I came from another country so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class.\n","\n","Second, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes and even they will hate from those classes. for example, I saw my friends that he took a music class but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that.\n","\n","Third, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all A's in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be.\n","\n","Finally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to and they like to take those classes.\n","\n","In conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should has be with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves.\n","'''\n","\n","least_disc_ex = '''\n","I am sure my heart is raising that I saw a lot of people behavior is going bazaar! Then it is said that your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because it creates trust, shows that your helping others, and creates a positive big impact on others.\n","\n","Your own behavior creates trust is to show that other can respect you and care about you. Friends behavior creates trust because they will sometimes help others. For example, if i have a huge injury and I can't walk, then probably they'll know that I'm not joking around and I'll trust them to help me. Another person behavior that creates trust is teachers, their behavior is mostly positive and always influence others. They'll always care about helping their student and makes the student trust the teacher what they need help on. Even though students think that teacher dont trust them, but others think teachers have faith on others to try hard to help and let them work hard for the future. Also, families creates trust so they will always have influence on me. It like i made their personality more positive than before. Your own behavior creates trust because of helping others, having positive personality, and increase better relationship on others.\n","\n","Showing that you help others is another way to influence other people from your own behavior. Sometimes my families help others and they will never forget about us. Like all of our family went to Generic_City and went on a mission to help others, like we build houses or feed a lot of poor people with food that we made. Another person that help others is friends, they always help me if i'm in a stress zone. They always comfort me feel better when I'm upset or mad. Also, teachers help other because they want the students to past the school. Although some of them might fail, yet teachers try their best to let them past. They want them to try hard so teachers need to make them work hard and help them learn. Like my teachers will try their best to help me past my quizzes or test. Helping others is the best way to influence people like friends, teachers, and families that they will support you and others what they need.\n","\n","The reason why your own behavior creates a big positive impact of others. So more and more people will show respect and will mostly love you. This will create a big positive impact on friends because I show love for them and they will probably love me back. All of us should always show love and care so that they wont hate you. For families, they always have a positive impact because of others positive attitude. Showing a good attitude can be like walking the bridge to their heart. This can help their feeling be better and better. Another person that have a big impact on others is firefighters. They always care about others and their lives so they always protect them when they're in trouble. There was one story that these firefighters that they need equipment because their tools is rusty and broken, but one person called them for help so they came the house was on fire and the wife is still trapped. So they got her out and she is save. So the husband so so proud, and send them 2,000 dollars a month so the firefighter can bye the equipment. This it to show how much the husband care about them. So this can create a big positive impact because of showing love, fixing feelings, and having risk to protect.\n","\n","Other might say that your own behavior can affect others. It has said that you own be behavior can influence other by showing that you help others create a positive big impact, and creates trust.
