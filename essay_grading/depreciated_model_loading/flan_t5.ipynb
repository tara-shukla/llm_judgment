But another parents they do not believe and force them to take those classes. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes.\\n\\nIn general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. Here are some reasons that is showed why they have to take those classes; like music, a drama, or an art class. First reason is if they took those classes, they can decrease their stress that they have in their life and their school. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Third reason is, if they really learned from those classes, they can teach to another persons and get money for that. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school.\\n\\nFirst, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require to take those classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. for example, I came from another country so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class.\\n\\nSecond, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes and even they will hate from those classes. for example, I saw my friends that he took a music class but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that.\\n\\nThird, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all A's in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be.\\n\\nFinally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to and they like to take those classes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should has be with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves.                                           \",\n          \"I am not agree because everybody in this world can be freedom to think or to do whetever they wan because we have the independence of right. They can enthusiasm for things or wons that they did.\\n\\nIf they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.\\n\\nyou never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.\\n\\nI will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.\\n\\nI hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that. Now i see and i can be better.\\n\\nYou can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.\\n\\nAlso there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.\\n\\nAnother example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.\\n\\nWhen i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.\\n\\nMy father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.\\n\\nWhen you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems. Our environment it will be consider many perspectives, and how we can work to balance our mind, health and see many solutions in our life.                     \",\n          \"Technology in people's live.\\n\\nTechnology have a positive effects in people's live, make you do thing better and easy, like if you don't want to go to the library you can read a book in the internet, or if yo don't want to go to the store and buy something you can buy that thing online technology is one of the more important thing in the world for many reasons, doctors use the technology to help you wen you have a problem and see what it is, or in the airports to see if you don't have something illegal if places like this don't use the technology is very complicate to do the job and more time to due.\\n\\nIn school we net the computer all of the time to do the homework and test and now is an important thing to have if you are in the school and no't only in the school also people that work from home or in any other job they net the technology, most of the job in this time net a computer, or any other type of technology, some people say that technology make negative effects in people life but on my opinion is not true because must of the people who say that use the technology to say that is bad and affect the population.\\n\\nI know the must of the people use the technology, or sometime of their live they use the technology and the technology help they to do something,a lot of the medicament that we know on this days are create for the technology, technology is not only computers and phones technology can be something pretty simple like a clock, is not necessary has to ve something very sophisticate, some people say that if you use the technology you don't have contact whit other people and something is true but that happen when you use the technology to much, but it does't mean that technology is bad if you use appropriate.\\n\\nWhat people net is responsibility to use the technology and know when they net to use, that way we can be more sophisticates, we can use the technology to talk, play video games,etc but we can also have time to stay whit the family and friends.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["essays =
