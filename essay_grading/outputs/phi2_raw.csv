I disagree with having a four day school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a four day school week would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a four day school week moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With a four day school week the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade.

Other people say schools should follow this model because, A four day school week means more time for each class and having more time in all classes its helpful for homework or late work, They can take advantage of having Friday off students can have a job only on Fridays.

, 'Dear Principal,

I agree with you i think making people do community service is good one example is because it would help our community a lot and it would be healthy. it would also keep people from doing bad things and more people would stop littering so other people won't have to pick their stuff they throw on the ground and people would also stop being lazy. People won't have to pick others up if you just throw your stuff in the trash and don't litter then people won't have to do community service so it's better to make people do community service till people will stop littering and being more responsible. People would also have more time if others stop littering and they would do what they want so they won't have to pick others trash up and have to throw it away for them. People would also be more kind to each other, children would stop doing it because if they litter they would have to do community service so they would get used to it and then they would stop littering. It's a good item to require community service and if you do require for students to do community service the community would be much better and more people would feel safe to be outside.'

I disagree with this statement. I think that we should try to do our goal. If we done with our goal. we should'not stop there. we should try some thing else. Beacuse our wishes never finish. So we should move on in other goal. For example if one person want to get high school diploma so when that person want to go to collage firs't that person have to achive the goal to go to collage. If we want to do our goal we have to work hard to get our goal.

Although Emerson's statement is write too some people they don't want to move on when they get there egolas. Beacuse if they are done with there gola thay just like to do that goal. i think that kind of people they don't want do move on with other goals beacuse they just want to focuse there first goal that the get. For example if some one want to be a teacher that person have to study to be a teacher. Every goal we want to get we have to work hard to get our goal. also some people they spend there hole life to try to get the goal. some time when we can't reach over goal we should'not give up"

Title: The Importance of Trying New Things

Introduction:
In life, it is important to challenge ourselves and try new things. This helps us grow and become better individuals.
