Word  classes include prepositions, pronouns, nouns, verbs, etc… Grammatical morphology includes third person, plural, possessive, etc…\n","# Syntax: Structuring sentences according to syntactic rules related to coordinating clauses, developing syntactic phrases (noun, verb,  preposition phrases), phrasal and clausal dependency, and transformations such as passives, relative clauses, and negations.\n","# Cohesive device: Cohesive devices are used as links between two or more items (e.g., words, phrases, clauses) in a text to enhance text  cohesion. These include the use of conjunctions (and, but, if, on the other hand), transitions (first, next, finally, for example), repetition of  words, phrases, and ideas across sentences and paragraphs, and the use of anaphor (pronouns replacing nouns).\n","# Simple, complex, and compound sentences\n","#  -Simple: Independent clause\n","#  -Complex: Independent and dependent clauses\n","#  -Compound: Two of more independent clauses\n","# Chunks: Multiple words that combine to have a single meaning. Often memorized without knowing what the individual words mean (e.g., “How are you” for “Hello”)\n","# Lexical bundles: Multiple word units that are common in English but are not idiomatic (“There is”). More common than collocations Collocations: Two or more words that are often used together (e.g., save time, go to bed, fast food)\n","# Idioms: multi-word unit where meaning not deducible from those of the individual words (kick the bucket, rain cats and dogs)\n","\n","# Overall\n","# Score 5: Native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\n","# Score 4: Facility in the use of language with syntactic variety and range of words and phrases; controlled organization; accuracy in grammar and conventions; occasional language inaccuracies that rarely impede communication.\n","# Score 3: Facility limited to the use of common structures and generic vocabulary; organization generally controlled although connection sometimes absent or unsuccessful; errors in grammar and syntax and usage.

rare negligible inaccuracies in word use.\n","# Score 4: Sufficient range of vocabulary to allow flexibility and precision; appropriate use of topic-related terms and less common lexical items\n","# Score 3: Minimally adequate range of vocabulary for the topic; no precise use of subtle word meanings; topic-related terms only used occasionally; attempts to use less common vocabulary but with some inaccuracy\n","# Score 2: Narrow range of vocabulary to convey basic and elementary meaning; topic-related terms used inappropriately; errors in word formation and word choice that may distort meanings\n","# Score 1: Limited vocabulary often inappropriately used; limited control of word choice and word forms;
