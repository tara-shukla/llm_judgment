Communication impeded in most cases by language inaccuracies.\\n\\nHere is Essay A:\\nSuccesses comes in so many diffrent whays,but the real questchon is how can having a good attitude lead you to being more successesful in life. I think that starts with your attitude ,attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a really big test in math class and you tell yourself befor the teast that your going to fail and your just having a negtive attitude about it, your more likely to fail ,but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your cofdent in yourself and your just going to give it your beast I thinkyour more likely to pass the teast.\\n\\nWhen you think of successes you think of famos people you might think of a person on tv or someone that hass lots of money. If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the strugle was they hade to get back up and push themself. There are successesful people every where fot example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister any one you know. Successes doesnt have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your familly to go to college or just geting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life.\\n\\nI try to be as successesful as I can if thats in school I try my beast,Whatever it is I know I cant acomlish anything without a good attitude. For example in the fuetre I want to be a fashon disinor, but that whount hapen for years but thers things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my futer ,I can start with a postive attitude There are hatters every where that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to creat a path for yourself.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nWhy is it good to have a good attitude even if you have a difficult time? When you have a job you cant go to work with a bad attitude people will never come back. In the other hand good attitude make people want to come back and take to you. Even if you have a difficult time at less show a smile for other people to see that can make them feel good,and that might even make you feel batter.\\n\\nThere are many successes people out who had a hard time and that made them feel down and be sad but that did not stop them from working hard and have a good attitude to other people. For example,one day i had a very bad day when i was outside,then this very nice old man came bye me smiled and waved is hand and i did the same thing and that made me in a good attitude this is way when you see someone who is not feeling good go and take to him.\\n\\nIn a other hand,my bother had a bed day in school so we were going home in till we seen a very old Lady sharing to cross the rode, but she cant so we want to help her, and she told us some positively words and that made my day and his. when you help other people or even show a smile or do something that will make someone be in a good attitude is thee bast thing that will make you feel good and them two.\\n\\nWhen you show a good attitude when you are having a difficult time the makes you a patter person,and everyone will love you,but when you are showing a bad attitude no one will like you. For example when i was waling to school this kid comes up to me and start saying words that made me mad and i had a difficult day,but i still showed good attitude to my people.\\n\\nwhen you have a good attitude,during a difficult time is a good thing people will learn from you people will was you as in example you will make new friends,will have a good job in life people will respect you even if your mad dont show it and make people mad and spread nigtivety all round just smile and make people feel good and if you have a bad day at dose not mane you have to make other people made with your attitude.

Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things.\\n\\nFirst reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for student's. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention.\\n\\nSecond reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes.

Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves.\\n\\nFirst, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff.\\n\\nAdditionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university\\n\\nHowever, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents.\\n\\nBased on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do. Some teenagers are responsible for they own self, this help them to be prepare for their own future, and be a teenager who can protect their self in a earlier age. This is gonna help teenager to maturity.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nYes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe.\\n\\nCity council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be.\\n\\nAdding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why.\\n\\nIf we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for the day.\\n\\nI am not saying that curfew is bad.

Communication impeded in most cases by language inaccuracies.\\n\\nHere is Essay A:\\nSome schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes. But what the school does not know is that many students don't really do the work. One thing about letting students using their phone in class is that they will not learn the proper way. A second reason to why it's bad for students to use their phones in class is because instead of doing their work they will be sending messages to their friends or cheating on the work. One last thing students could do is say that they did the work already when they haven't done it. They will lie to the teacher and then the teacher will believe them. Students will later complain about not understanding what the teacher is talking about. This reasons will affect the students in one way or the other.\\n\\nMy first reason to why students shouldn't have the privilege to use their cell phones in class is because they won't study or learn the proper way. When the teacher allows them to use their cell phones in class they won't know where to go. Students will eventually not do the work because they won't know what to do. Doing work on phones is not as easy as it seems. Iv'e experienced this as well. It is confusing and hard. I have seen this at my school, when students are allowed to use their phone in class they don't where to go or where to start. I also see that my classmates don't learn anything when they use their phones for a classwork. I see them with a confused face and waiting for the teacher so he can explain the instructions one more time. Students would also get notifications on their phones and it will distract them from what they are supposed to be doing. They'll end up doing something else and not learn anything from their work. When my teacher makes us do work on our phones it is really hard to pay attention because keep getting notifications. It is really stressful to try to ignore the notifications.\\n\\nMy second reason is that students will slack off and do something else on their phone. Many students now use their phones to send messages to their friends. For example, if a student gets caught in class messaging their friends they will get in trouble and will get their phone taken away for the entire day or until the end of class. But, if teachers let their students use their phones during class, the students will get away with messaging their friends and won't get a punishment. I see this myself too in my classes in my school. I see the teacher telling the students that they can use their phone in class for a classwork. But some certain kids don't do the classwork because they are messaging their friends instead. This is not the only thing students do when they are allowed to use their phones in class. Students will cheat on the class work that the teacher assigned them to do. Then they will get used to cheating on classwork and they will keep doing it. If students get used to cheating in high school then they will do it when they get older. If they ever get caught cheating later on in the future they will get in big trouble.\\n\\nMy last reason to why teachers shouldn't let their students use their cell phones in class is because they will lie saying that they already finished their work. I always see students in my class say that they already finished the work when I know that they haven't. It is not fair for the other students because they will do the work but some just lie saying that they did it. If the teacher finds out that the student lied then, the student would get in trouble. The students that lie are the ones who will get a bad grade if there is a test or quiz related to what the work teacher assigned them to do. Although, lying may not seem like a big deal when you are younger it is a big deal once you are older. The students will get used to lying and will carry it with them as their life.\\n\\nI have seen students lie to their teachers about their work.

Once in a while is never to bad to help out in the community. I think kids should be able to hang out with their friends and some days help out in the community. Make the kids sign up on a paper to do community service when the kids have time and if they cant or don't want to help the community people cant force them.

I strongly agree that students should be allowed to graduate high school as soon as possible, to continue on a career they're passionate about in life. It's a good idea for students to finish high school in the span of three years, so they could get a head start in the work they would like to pursue.\\n\\nJobs will want fresh and new minds coming out of high school and they'll as sure help the students get into a college to get the degree and start the career they really enjoy. Students that would like to service or work for will be a great opportunity to put in their resume and say that they have experience in tasks that was given to them as an intern for a similar job they want to do. Some students that leave school in three years start to have issues and have no clue in what they want to do after they leave the school. The students that choose to do that will likely not be accepted in a job they want, since they will have no clue as what they are doing. That's why students that actually want to end high school in those years take certain elective courses to help them understand the career, and make them comfortable to start the job when they are ready for hands on tasks. I think that all high schools in the district should offer these programs for students, that way they see themselves excel over time and feel like they great about decision the made to pursue the career they want to make a living.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome school shouldn't offer programs that allow high school students to graduate with in three years. One reason why high school shouldn't offer programs that allow high school students to graduate with in three years is because having another year of high school can help the students out a lot. It gives them more time to improve their GPA. The second reason why high school shouldn't offer programs that allow high school students to graduate with in three years is because there are students that still don't know what kind of career they want to have for their future. Finally, the third reason why school shouldn't offer programs that allow high school students to graduate with in three years is because some students struggle and have a really difficult time to stay focus in school. Also, students get to follow behind in their classes.\\n\\nSome school shouldn't offer programs that allow high school students to graduate with in three years.

Students start to lacks off, getting lazy, and not giving effort. Also, students get to follow behind in their classes. When students are following behind in there classes, it takes them a little more time to catch up with their classmates.

For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.\\n\\nStudents who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.\\n\\nFor example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.\\n\\nOne of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.\\n\\nOn the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.\\n\\nIn conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome students should be offered distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students that live to far from schools and don't have there transportation.

They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy.\\n\\nThe technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future.\\n\\nEvery student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime.

Thomas Jefferson once said, \"Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" Always staying active can improve your state of mind and benefit you in multiple ways such as tournaments or exams. Also, staying active contributes to mainly anything that you are working towards and trying to achieve. However, some people may say that staying inactive can resolve a lot of issues in ones life. Although that might be the true for some, contributing and staying active can also distract the person from life\\'s worst moments.\\n\\nFirst, staying active can change a person\\'s state of mind. By making them see a different view point, one can focus more and not have any insecurity\\'s. Many believe staying active can change ones mood and attitude. This can be a great tool for a student that is under a lot of stress over school and school work. Instead of the student staying home and watching television, the student can go for a jog, a hike, or to a gym, overall boosting his mental health. Being in a physical active state can be a get away for some, by being able to relieve and sooth the stress in ones situation. Although, staying physically active can benefit a person\\'s health and state of mind, others might take a different approach and be mentally active. Some go for a run or hike, while others might use up their time to stay home and study or read a novel.\\n\\nSecond, others use the time they have to be productive and contribute to either themselves or others. Many use these two methods as a distraction, to make a person forget or lose track of what might stumble them. On another note, a person in a neighborhood might want to form a neighborhood watch group, to look out and keep his neighborhood safe. Staying active with your community can provide a chain in bravery throughout the community and accomplish a strong bond. Others can use this as inspiration and make something constructive and positive, while also distracting them from other problems and complications that they might be going through. More can be accomplished as a community that is active with each other.\\n\\nA general misconception is that staying idle or inactive can serve a purpose. To accomplish something, mainly needs activity and productiveness. Some will say it is like a team, with a team you need everyone to contribute and stay active with each other. But if one is not active then he brings no purpose to the team, and does not accomplish anything. Although, people do believe that inactivity can serve a purpose, it cannot out weigh the fact the people that are active can achieve more then someone that is inactive.\\n\\nTo conclude, staying active can most definitely boost your performance in school work or in sports. It can also be used as a distraction, to block and take the mind off of other thoughts the person might be having. There are multiple ways staying active can benefit either yourself or others. It may also increase your self-esteem and mood, your mental health can be tremendously effected in a positive manner. Also, always doing something can be a good habit to have or making a list of chores to do, it helps to mature and organize yourself and your day. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nIn my opinion, I know why Thomas Jefferson decide to wrote this for his people.

Instead, it is important for the students to find the specific career and graduate before time. In point of view, some students can choose, if they want to a specific career or more. In thesis statement, students can find the specific career because is great opportunity and good idea.\\n\\nFirst reason, some students are considered to find the specific career. Because they want to enter to the college at their young age. For example, Generic_Name was prepare to enter to the college at her 17th years old and she win a scholarship, and enter to Generic_School to study her specific career. This shows that students can achieve their goals at their young age, that nothing is impossible.\\n\\nSecond reason, some students have to find the specific career. Because they want to prepare before graduate of high school. For example, Generic_Name had her classes pass and all the credits before 12th grade and she apply to the college to her specific career. Being students it's not easy to achieve this specific goal, but with work hard and perseverance all is possible.\\n\\nThird reason, some students think that they can't commit to a career at a young age. Because they don't have courses to guide toward a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is in 12th grade and she wants to graduate before, but she don't pass her SOL and she have the enough credits for graduate. So this shows that students can't commit to a career. If they don't have everything that is necessarily to find the specific so they cannot achieve anything.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is important for the students to find a specific career at a young age. However, it is a great idea to find the career that proponent to achieve before the time of graduate and get all that you need like: credits, grades,\\n\\nexams, and courses. Also, this is a great opportunity if you want to be someone professional in this society. So be positive and perseverant.     \\n Which essay is better?

But the teenagers of this time never think in consequences when they are following bad examples. So I believe that a good example by your own behavior is the best way to infuence other people because people learn things by examples, or if you get together with somebody who is not a good influence for you believe or not your are going to learn what he does. People is always around you they are always looking what you do and they are criticizing your actions.\\n\\nMy first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. Many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. People can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. The world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why there\\'s too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. If human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming.\\n\\nIn my own experience I have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. Is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. When you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. As you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. Adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person.\\n\\nPeople is always criticizing so if you don\\'t want to that happen be a good example. Being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. And when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. My grandma always said , \" what you crop, you would sow.\" For me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too.\\n\\nFor these reasons I believe that a good example is the best way to influence others so the people that is learning or looking what you do can learn good things about you and by that wat can trust in you. Also you will feel proud of yourself that your are influencing other in a right way. If you want a better world be a good example for others and don\\'t lose your time in influencing other in a bad way.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nTo be fair, there are many ways to influence people around you. Everyone have their own kind of way to influence others. Some by their competitive actions and some by their superb behaviors, but not all of these influences can be effective. As Albert Schweitzer said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing.\" The fascinating way to inspire someone is setting a better example by your own behavior because you are not changing yourself physically in order to be inspiring, you are just behaving with a compelling attitude and feelings. Also everybody can easily trust you.\\n\\nThe power to affect other people is the way you behave. Your behavior is your power, it does not costs you anything to change an aggressive attitude to an absorbing attitude. You can change your behavior by your own actions, your own actions, your own actions.\\n', 'response_only': '.

They know what to do when it comes to the important matters in life. They aren\\'t dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they don\\'t listen to other people and don\\'t make their decisions based on what other people say.\\n\\nSelf-Reliant people know how to get through their important or \"life changing\" decisions. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. They think through about what decision they are going to make. People that don\\'t make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. You can learn a lot from making important decisions by yourself and it can help you in the long run.\\n\\nSelf-Reliant people aren\\'t dependent on other people and always follow their instincts. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions you\\'ve made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life.\\n\\nMaking your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision you\\'ve made affects your life every day. Most people always seem to ask somebody for help on a very important decision,\\n\\nwhile others just think about what they should do themselves. People should just follow their instincts, their gut feeling of what they want to do; they shouldn\\'t listen to other peoples opinions. The people should always try to make their own decisions instead of always relying on the guidance of experts and authorities.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome people who value self-reliance define it as a need to follow their own instinct or ideas then others. In my opinion people should seek guidance from experts and let them know about life\\'s important matters. Many people out there dont stop and think twice about their actions.\\n\\nPeople should seek some guidance and let others help them. The majority of people that doesn\\'t know the risk of their actions ends up dead or get seriously injured. Others that values self-reliance follows their own decisions, ideas, and instincts. Knowing life\\'s importance matters can help you a lot through life; not doing what you know is wrong or letting others influence you. The fact that people dont know how cruel the world can be is just unbelievable. Others may think they know everything but life\\'s is filled with unexpected things. Life has multiple paths for you, the wrong path, or the right path. Its hard when you got everything under control and one second later everything could just disappear.\\n\\nI agree that people should get the guidance they need to know whats expected and be ready for anything that can be taken away or struggles. Many people shouldnt feel ashamed about anything its okay that others needd guidance.\\n Which essay is better?

Some students don't know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life.\\n\\nNow for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they don't know. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. In other cases that i haven't really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future.\\n\\nI would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City. I also love doing makeup, since i was little i would always play with makeup and growing up i would buy a lot of makeup but didnt really know how to use the products. until i started by little learning how to use the products.

In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities.

As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Now by attention I don't mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.\\n\\nWhat I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems.\\n\\nIn 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person.\\n\\nThis might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they don't want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they don't want people to know. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they don't need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often.\\n\\nNow why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why it's importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a slout in the world that people don't care about. It helps people to be able to talk to their\", 'response_only': \" in the world that people don't care about.

Churchchill's is right that failure is the pursuit of success. You have to try to do what you want to do.\\n\\nIf you have a dream to become someone you want to fight for it. Make good choices and try hard. Sometimes is hard to achieve your dreams, because maybe you are not capable to do things or you don't know how or where to start. You can ask for help to your parents, teacher, and people outside of school, so they can help you with something. People make mistakes, And they learn from it. You have to try over and over to do what makes you happy. You can fall down one or three times, but you have to get up many times you can.\\n\\nMake a plan, and write down the things that you want to do, and don' t be shy to ask for help when you needed. Be a enthusiam person, If you fail to do something try to do it again. Nothing is easy in life, with effort everything is possible. If you are in school try to do your best at school and ask questions to your teachers. For example: I am a high school student. At first I was a very shy person, well I'm still a shy person but not like I was before. I was shy to ask for help to my teachers and whenever I needed help I didn't know what to do because I was shy and quiet. At first I did't know how to ask for help, but then I realize that without asking for help to my teachers I was not going to succed, and I would never learn how to do things.\\n\\nI was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something, so everytime I needed something I used to go locked my self in my room and figuring thing out, But I also learn to ask them for help, even though they don't speak english, they still helped me with my school work. You have to do the same thing and ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you, so you can succed in your life, If you have bad friends stay away from them, because they are not good people and you are going to end up ruining your life.\\n\\nI believe that if you fail, try to do it again. Do what makes you happy and succed in your life. Make an effort and achieve your dream, because you are living of that, And if you fall down get up and do it again.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nSuccess consists in how people manage their own enthusiasm and how responsible they are about their acts. every person makes mistakes every day and they are responsible for it, but that is how people learn every day from every mistakes they have committed from the beginning until now. Mistakes help you learn and get better and better until you understand the concept about what you are doing. Some people think that by making mistakes you will fail something, but notes that at the end you will get results from it. A lot of people fail everyday and that doesn't mean that you're not perfect because no one is perfect in these world, but the main idea is to look for the best way to manage or do something and also to keep forward.\\n\\nFailure is just the key to keep looking forward in these world. We have the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from it, that is how people progress to became someone in the future. failure is a lesson that these world give us to keep learning and at the end to find a solution and continue our lives. however, there are a lot of people that think that failure is like an stop sign that don't let us keep looking forward, but failure is just a process in which people try to do things that they don't want to do, and that is why they fail.\\n\", 'response_only': \" try to do things that they don't want to do, and that is why they fail.\\n\"}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Second reason, if you have knowledge but you can not use it so imagination is good for that. lastly, if you imaging anything thats are real and not real it is more fun than having knowledge.\\n\\nIf some body is sick that she or he want to make some thing but he or she can not make it so they have to imagine what they they want to make. It help the children young and old people that are sick and they can not due things that they want . If you are not happy because you want to make something that can help the people but you can not because you don't imagine things that can help you with that thing that how you get sick so you have to imagine thing.\\n\\nYou have knowledge but you can not use it so you have to imagine things that can help you and your knowledge. That how you can make some thing and without imagination we are nathing in this world.

It is fun and children can imagine thingsmlike having there own house, buildings, and cars.\\n\\nDo you now that 50% of people imagine things that are not real so why you dont imagine thing it good for you and youre family imagine all day. I imagine all day and my family to so it is good when we want to watch move we all make up a store and we tell everybody. So imagine all day.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nHave you ever thought to your self is imagination more important than knowledge? Well I know I have I also agree with Albert Einstein that imagination is more important than knowledge because there is many things that you can do using your own imagination, and there is a lot of thing that you can benefit from when you are using your imagination. Our imagination also helps because of what we learn we can remember that for the next time when we need help remembeing something.\\n\\nFirst, If you use your imagination there is a lot of things that us as humans can do with our imagination. If people didn't use thie rimagination how would they be able to make things like shoes,clothes,and also our homes. Without imagination everything on this world would be the same there wouldn't really be a difference and everyone would probably be dressed the same too. For example,the clothes and shoes that people wear now are different becuase the people who make them use their imagination to come up with different type of ideas to make clothes and shoes. Imagination can be a real impact on people now than it probably was before because now people have to use their imagination to come up with thigns that they don't know. Another example would be if they have a project to get done and don't knwo what to write they would have to use their imagination to come up with something to write. If teachers don't know what to teach for the day they have to use their imagination to come up with a plan to teach for the day. If imagination didn't exist than people would be struggling because imagination is really important, and it can really help you when you are in a rough decision and you don't know what to do.\\n\\nin conclusion, I agree that imagination is more important than your knowledge because their is a lot of things that you can benefit from your imagination. Also people can learn more when they use their imagination,and they can also learn how to come up with different thigns to do when you don't know what to do or you don't understand anything that you might be working on.

If you\\'re not doing something to help you get better, you\\'er failing, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life, and inactivity does not serve a purpose to this quote. Although, others may think different and disagree with this quote, other people in this world needs this motivation.\\n\\nIf you\\'re not doing something to help you get better, you\\'re failing. This role plays a huge part of others because failing is not a choice. You may fail a couple of times on this and that but what are you doing to not fail again? If something isn\\'t right and want to fix it, do something about it.\\n\\nIn the other hand, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life. I play baseball for 10 years now and my goal is to make it to the big leagues but with this being my goal, I have to do something to help me achieve my goal. Success is not giving to you, you have to earn that success and by that, do something to help you succeed your dream.\\n\\nAt the end, inactivity does not serve a role in this act. Inactivity is getting in the way of you not achieving and succeeding. I take inactivity as a negative act because I dont want to be sitting at home or anywhere not doing something to help me get better. Be the one who changes your life by doing what it takes to do something in life to reach your highest goals.\\n\\nLet this quote be a inspiration of achieving and succeeding in life or at anything. Be the one that can make a change. Doing something makes you accomplish more. It takes effort and hard work to do something but at the end, it all pays off. Only you can change yourself whether you want to be successful or not.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nBe active or not active in life, those are two options that we have. There is many reason why people are active in life, but there are many other reasons why people stay inactive on their lifetime. Thomas Jefferson said, \"Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" Staying active and with determination people have more chances to be successful in life.\\n\\nFirst of all, in reality things can\\'t be done by them self. For instance, the first TV, car, plane, cell phone, etc... wouldnt be done with out a lot of hard work. Another example could be, the creators of all the things that we have now, they didnt stop or give up on their goals they were active and positive in the process to success.\\n\\nIn addition, in order to accomplish great goals people must stay active and work hard for them.\\n\\nFor example, the best basketball player of all time wouldn\\'t have accomplish all the records with out dedication in the process. Another example, if Martin Luther King didn\\'t do things or stayed back with out doing anything for the people, we probably wouldnt have the life that we all have right now.\\n\\nPerhaps most important, people have more chances to success in life if they stay active and working on good things, more than if they stay inactive. For example, a hard worker business man probably have way more success in life than a regular person that instead of working hard and do things prefer to stay back and be inactive.\\n\\nSome people argue that, inactivity serves a purpose. They say that, the fact that people are doing something doesn\\'t mean that what they doing is right. This might be true; however, inactivity wont take people anywhere but to fail in life, and for success in life people must to do things that they can\\'t do in life.\\n\\nIn the end, inactivity serves a purpose.', 'response_only': \" that they can't do in life.\\n\\nIn the end, inactivity serves a purpose.\"}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Well I disargree with that because, what if someone came up to you and said, my mom bought me this dress and said it looks good at me and asked you if it looks good on her. Well what if you said no it looks ugly for you then, the girl will be hurt and would think that her mom lied to her and will start crying.\\n\\nAnther reason is, what if your friend got in troublem and said he didn't do it but, you knew he did it and the teacher ask you if he did it and you said yes.

For that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings.\\n\\nFirst, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened. Also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you don't want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times.\\n\\nThen, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times.\\n\\nNext, not hiding anything frank from people. For example, Generic_Name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. like you don't wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. if you don't be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for.\\n\\nIn conclusion, no one questioned the honesty of the judge's statement. so these are my main reasons to support why i agree with this old proverb says honesty is the best policy. \\n Which essay is better?

I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. I learn more when I imagine things at school or other places.\\n\\nTo begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when I\\'m mad or just in general. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I don\\'t learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class.\\n\\nAlso, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I don\\'t understand especially when it comes to English and math. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph.\\n\\nIn addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn.

And i think its a good idea for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because they can spend time with friends or you can join a club that can help you with your homework and if you want to play a sport,you can sigh up for a activity that doesnt need to tryout for that sport And if you want to get some college credits then you can sigh up for an activity that can help you get some college credit a good way to get some,there is multiple ways to get some college credits like a good one is learning a language that is a good way to some college credit. you have nothing to do after school you can join an activity that can keep you busy. And this is why i agree with the principal because it can help us in the further on in life.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome years ago before my uncle became a doctor, I saw how he was struggling with anxiety attacks of too much studying time at medical school, but he noticed that he needed to do different activities to get distracted a little bit and at the same time get rid of all the stress. Every student participating at least in one extracurricular activity is a really good idea because they could do sports, get in book clubs or help around doing community service. If all the students would do extra activities , they're lives could be really different and better in many ways with variations of experiences and less stress.\\n\\nStudents doing any sports would be really helpful for their health. Mostly every student at school is seating on a chair for hours and at home they are probably just also seating on the couch for more hours . A human body needs to move and do some exercise to have a good health. Sports are really a good ting that makes your body feel or have some changes just like on teens they're metabolism makes them get taller or develop their bodies. Even if the students do just 20 minutes a day stills helpful for them.\\n\\nBook clubs are something really interesting and fun for students to do. Do you ever just feel like your mind needs a break? Well books are the best option as a break , they take you to many different places around the world even places that dont even exist without moving from anywhere you are at. You can find new adventures, drama, romance and some things you never experienced; just like transferring your mind to another world, and distracting you from your regular life. Making you have and enjoy some good time without going somewhere. In the book clubs you can discuss with people about all those thoughts you have about what you just read, and could also find someone that thinks the exact same things as you.\\n\\nDoing community service not only helps others, it also helps you! You might be asking yourself right now how? Well, helping your community it's teaching you as a student how important cooperation is , helping others brings you happiness, and that feeling of how responsible you are becoming. Also, community service helps students a lot with credits for an advanced diploma or even a scholarship for college. If you never have helped your community thinking is nothing fun, you should consider it as a extracurricular activity that you can do.\\n\\nEvery student should do an extracurricular activity after schools so theyre body and mind can have an productive break.

I think it is very important for us as student's to help in the community service. It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash can's when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i don't think another person would pick it up but they should. We don't want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. That's why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others don't want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community.

A lot of students have been complaining about it . And I personally only like to help elementary students not cleaning. Everyone has problems and community service is just not right to everyone. Basically for the students that do want to make a difference of what schools and students are right now. And cleaning litters is like a punishment to us. Helping children not so much , but honestly I Think some people should attend to community service to help children, And other stuff.

I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things.\\n\\nI think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week.\\n\\nMy first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.\\n\\nSecond point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students.\\n\\nMy position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think.\\n\\nMy conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they don't add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nI think this is not good idea ffom the schools to follow this model by esxtending this schools days for two more hoursand caming only 4 days schols. They are many reason why my schools should not follow this. One of the reason is because they will not save ennergy by making us came only for 4 days to schools. Anther reason is if they make us stay here for 2 more hours same same student the work in part time jod they will lose there job fron caming late. final reason why my schools should not follow this is because same Student in this school have babys and they have to go and take care of thent. those are my reason why my schools should not follow the rule\\n\\nThe firt reason why my schools shoukd not have the rule is beasue they will not same any energey.

Two years ago,in 2017,me and my best friend,Generic_Name,are ready for our first day of middle school. We were excited to see each other,we were excited because Generic_Name moved 3 years ago, in third grade. I was sad at first but until my mom say that they move not that far,my mom takes me to his house every weekends. Now when we start school i gonna see him every day. It because we have the same class and i was happy we have the same classes together. When i got to school i see Generic_Name in a far distance and start running to each other like we never seen each other before for a very long time. Now we start learning classes together every day\\n\\nWe where in English class to do a act of kindness to your best friend or closes friend. I say i was gonna do with Generic_Name,but then Generic_Name mom called him from the front office to pick him up. i said to Generic_Name what going on,he said \"i dont know\". soon after he didnt came to school for four days i was getting worried if his family are okay. i called to him many time,but he did not answer. until Monday he came to school looking sad, i said,\"what happen\",he said that his grandma was very ill and might not make it .I felt sad too because his grandma was like my grandma. She been treating me like i was her grandson. Soon my mom took me to see the grandma to see if she okay.\\n\\nOnce i got home from visiting the grandma of Generic_Name,i was thinking what should i do to cheer up Generic_Name and his family. I was thinking for a full one hour,and then i was thinking why not buy them presents for the family. So on Sunday i went to the Nike shoe store,Walmart,target,and shoppers when i got there at Walmart i was thinking,\" what should i get for the mom and dad\",While i was thinking i went to the Nike store next to Walmart to buy his older brother air force one,that cost about $299 dollars. I said why am i spending money on expensive stuff. Then i went to target to get a $50 dollars gift card for Generic_Name and his little brother. So in total it cost me $100 dollars. Then i went to buy balloons for the grandma, it say,\"god is here to protect you\". Right after, i went back to Walmart to buy a vase that cost me $42.

There is a lot of good and bad things between these two options. Most people may choose to work in groups for differents reasons. Here are some of the reason why I think that working in group in better than working alone. Some people like to work in groups because they like to finish faster, also it is a good choice because the information taht you need to look for is divide with all the group members, finally it is good because you meet new people in the group to work with.\\n\\nThe first reason why working in a group is better than working alone is because you can finish faster. For example if you work by your-self on a big project you are going to take more time to finish it. Probably you can finish it on time but you are going to spend a lot of time then you. Then if you work in a group everybody in the group can hellp to get it done more fast. With the help of all the members the work is going to be done on time and you are going to have more time for yourself. With more time for yourself you can play video games, watch your favorite show or take a good time to study for another class or a test.\\n\\nAnother reason why working in a group is a benefit rater than work alone is because you divide the information about the topic with all the members of the group. For example if you are in high school and you get a big project then there is two choices to do it by yourself or work in group. I think most people in your class will prefer to work in groups because there will be a lot of information to look for. In a group all the members are going help in the project to get a good grade. Everybody are going to be proud of what they did together. Also they can be the best project on the class.\\n\\nThe last reason why working in groups is better than working alone is because everybody in the group meet new people. For example in your class you do not talk to all your classmates and this is a good opportunity to talk to them. Maybe in the past you were thinking that they were bad people but doing the project together that let you know that they are awesome. Meeting new people is good because sometimes others may feel alone and letting yourself meet them and letting them meet you, both are going to feel a different way. Sometimes what we just need is a good friend to talk and to do homework with. Some people are going to be disagree with this idea because they may not like to meet new people or because they like to be by their selves.\\n\\nIn conclusion working in groups is a good choice because it has good benefits. You can get more time for yourself by finishing faster with the help of your group members. You have lest information to look for because there are other members that are looking for other information. Finally you can meet new people and became a friend of them. There are some other benefits that help to work in a group and understand more about a topic with the halp of all the members.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nToday I will like to explain to you the benefits of working with a group. In my opinion working with a group make things more easy and fun because students have the chance to exchange ideas and also learn more from each others it als help us to see things from different points of view.\\n\\nFirst, working with a group make things more easy for students because they will all work together in each part of the assignment, one student can do the research while the other one write the information the other student can be looking for graphs or other information that they might need, students also get to have fun by working with a group because they can talk to each others and learn more about each other.\\n\\nSecond, working with a group make things more fun for', 'response_only': ' and learn more about each other.\\n\\nSecond, working with a group make things more fun for'}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Some say sayings have a reason for example Thomas Jefferson wrote \"Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something\", Does this mean it is true because he said it? Or is it just something he wrote because it was his opinion?\\n\\nI strongly agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote, it\\'s saying in little words don\\'t be lazy, it\\'s amazing how much can get done if we are always doing something. If we are always doing something other than what we want to accomplish it takes time and the process just gets longer. I believe that inactivity serves a purpose even though your inactive or active some or many things can be accomplished.\\n\\nOne reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, more can be accomplished when you are not active and working. I have experienced this numerous of times at my job. At my job,\\n\\nwe have task we have to get done by a certain time which is closing and sometimes those task don\\'t get done due to how busy the store gets, when the store gets busy we can\\'t get what we want accomplished, but say we are not active, or working and the place gets slow and calm. We have the time to get our task done and meet the requirements and leaving on time. When you are super active and busy it get hectic and that just adds more to your tasks. For example your making some food, drinks and theres more and more orders, you can\\'t make something then clean your gonna have to keep going and clean it all up at the end when it slows down. In my opinion you get what you want accomplished when your less active in this case.\\n\\nAnother reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, when your not active you don\\'t know what your gonna accomplish that day, but out of boredom your gonna get something out of it. This happens to me all the time where one day i\\'m just free all day with absolutely nothing to do, and i just lay in bed with a mess in my room not even thinking about the mess and all of a sudden I start cleaning everything and organizing everything. Like Thomas Jefferson says \"Determine never to be lazy... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something\" In this case it works both ways because if your doing something you get something accomplished and something good out of it, but if your doing absolutely nothing then you get nothing accomplished.\\n\\nLastly I believe that inactivity serves a purpose because, say your going to try out for the boys or girls soccer team and there is only 1 spot left. Obviously your going to need to practice everyday and know how to play. Practice makes perfect the more active you are with soccer, the more chances your gonna get that last spot to be a member of the soccer team, but say you really want the last spot but your just not as good as the others and it\\'s a new sport you just wanna try out but you are not practicing everyday to get better. If you don\\'t practice everyday to get better then there are less chances of you making that last spot just because you weren\\'t as active and on it like the others. The more practice you receive the more chances you will have to get that last spot because of the dedication with no activity done theres no hope in that.\\n\\nIn conclusion, inactive or active you get through your day and learn something new and that is a accomplishment so much can be done in many different situations, anything is possible. At one point through your day you accomplish making it through even if you felt like you didn\\'t accomplish anything you must have, because you learn something new that is the biggest accomplishment.\\n\\nI hope this helps you to get better at your writing and I hope you will find this', 'response_only': '\\n\\nI hope this helps you to get better at your writing and I hope you will find this'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

I feel like we do need to have year round schools. Because when we go back to school most of the students don't remember anything from last year, we would get more days to understand things and remember it.\\n\\nIf we start to remember things we did we would not need to have to go over so many things and get to the new stuff for like Math, History, English. The more days were in school we understand the things more and it will stick to us more. Because the more that we start doing in class and we get help with it, we will know what to do when it comes for us to takes test or Sols.\\n\\nLike sometimes when I come back to school I really don't remember what we learned last year or how to do certain problems for math or what ever class it is. But maybe with this year round school thing I might be able to remember these things depending what we learn in class. I think the reason we don't remember things so much is because we really don't pay attention or we're not really focused on what we're learning. So now with the more days we have maybe we could get a chance to try different teaching methods so the other students can get more attached to what we are learning about and focus more o things in class.\\n\\nI'm liking the idea of this year round school, because there more opportunities we can have and more ways so we can focus because of the days were going to have. The only downfall of this is that are summer is going to be less than usually but I mean well get other days off so thats good. Hopefully with this new school thing it will be easier to remember all the information and things we learn.\\n\\nI feel like that the year round school thing could work, it would help out tons of people with remembering things. So there classes could become easier because they would remember what they did last year and know how the problem or question is. It would honestly help me out a lot because I would be able to do more work because I would know how to do the work. I think this would work and be very successful so we can try and see what happens! \\n and here is Essay B: \\nI dont think its a good idea to make summer break shorter. Making summer break shorter means youll spend less time with your family, but I dont think the students family would like the break short. Three months of summer break gives many students a lot of time to relax and have fun will their friends and family.\\n\\nWinter break doesnt need to be longer who wants to be in the cold for theyre break?\\n\\nalmost everyone prefers their break in a sunny breezy day. Having breaks while students have school will make students forget everything they learned and I highly doubt theres some students who is willing to study over the the break in the school year.\\n\\nMy personal opinion on this idea is that its unnecessary making summer break short and other breaks longer, such as Thanksgiving,Winter,and Spring is only meant to give student a little break, but making it longer is just gonna make students lazy and not want to come to school, so thats why we summer break so students can have a really long break from school.                                                                                                                                \", 'response_only': '                    '}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

There are so many things you can do when you play an instrument. Everyone has seen marching bands doing all types of exciting things in the middle of a football game. Have you not seen the routines they make, those take hard work! Orchestras play classical music and make their sound flow in the room. Not only do they play classical music, but they also play loud and exciting music. Everything you can do while playing an instrument is enjoyable. Some things are more enjoyable than others like being able to listen to yourself making good music, going on fun field trips, and being able to find all different types of music.\\n\\nWhile playing an instrument you play all different types of music, and all of the pieces of music are good. When you hear yourself play a song well you get a boost of confidence. Hearing your class play well makes you confident that your concert will sound great. It feels good to know that you're capable of playing music that others who aren't able to do. You get to enjoy the amazing sound your class makes. Whenever you play an instrument you normally audition for the class you want to get into and when you get into it, you are full of joy. It's always nice to know that you can achieve the level that you want to achieve. The opportunities you get while playing an instrument are endless.\\n\\nWhen being in band or orchestra you get the opportunity to go on field trips. Schools don't normally go on field trips unless the students are in band or orchestra. They offer the field trips to people who play an instrument because of all their hard work they put into it. All the field trips you go on are enjoyable because of the people in your class. You always make friends whenever you join band or orchestra. Some schools know that the students want more fun, so they include more field trips than others. Every field trip is a gift to the students who play their instruments from the school. Some places that schools go to are Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park, and many more exciting places. Those all have roller coasters, water activities, and carnival games, who wouldn't want to go there.\\n\\nEvery movie or show has a soundtrack which the classes can play.

Educators say that students spent too much time during breaks, and that make them to not remember their classes perfectly after their break. I would say that I agree with them, because students can get tired of school after too much time on a break, students would retain more information, and educators would feel more comfortable with their students. Some people also believe that there should be a shorter summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.\\n\\nSometimes students get tired after a long break, I know people that do an amazing job while they are in school, but when the moment finally arrives to take a long break, they suddenly start failing their classes after the break, because of this reason. 3 years ago I had a friend who every year at the beginning of the school year until the first long break, he always had good grades, but when was the time to take a break, he came back with bad grades. Even with me, I have never been a person with the best grades, but when I take a break I am even worst.\\n\\nStudents could retain more information if their breaks are shorter. Students would have a fresh mind since they have a shorter break. For example my brother who is 17 years old, has excellent grades, he is the best in every of his classes, but every time he takes a long break most of his grades decrease considerably. He always says \"I would prefer to have shorter breaks.\" He believes that his classmates hates him because they said he is a nerd, just because he just wants a shorter break.\\n\\nSince students have a fresh thought due they have a shorter break, educators would feel more comfortable with their students, because they do not have to teach them again old stuff in order to try to refresh their minds. For the students this could also be good, they can progress in every subject quickly and move forward to the next unit.\\n\\nSchools should implement a system that functions like this, if a class move quickly to new units and students have good grades, they can take that class just during 2 quartes, or 1 semester, so students can take more classes in a shorter period of time.\\n\\nFinally, I agree with most of the educators, students should have shorter breaks in order to, retain more information easily, be more active, and educators can feel more comfortable with them. I also agree with the people that say that there should be a shorter summer break and the rest of the breaks longer.       \\n and here is Essay B: \\nShould school have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall? People said most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. However I believe that students should have a longer summer break because a long summer break will give the student time to travel, spend time with their family, and work in summer. The first thing you can do by having a long summer break is travel overseas without worried about how many day you can stay. By travel overseas you need time to explore the country go around the city, and enjoy yourself. Cause travel in a different country you can learn new thing that you never learn anywhere, or experience the thing that you learn in school like go to a history site that you learn from history class. Traveling is not all about playing around didn\\'t learn anything, but you can have your choose of where you want to go, and what you want to do.\\n\\nI agree with most of the educators, students should have a longer summer break, a', 'response_only': '.\\n\\nI agree with most of the educators, students should have a longer summer break, a'}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

The students and teachers can get more a free dar, that day we can take sleep, study for other you need study someting, enjoy with your family, develop your self and what do I want to do. I can have many good someting for you. But the other days, you have the school day two more hours. You need think about now. We have seven hour on school, you dose not tired for long times in school? The seven hour is very long time,\\n\\nevery early morning all students wake up the may de am 5:30 or 6:00, you need take prepare to go to school, and stay there for seven hour. But if we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours, you should loss the two hours from many something. For example, I can't have a sleep, study for you need know someting, enjoy with my family, develop my self, and what do I want to do. Because of we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours. If we have two more hour in school, we need stay two more hour in school, more study. I don't want to lossing my five day's happy and free. We need more think about what is really good for us. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nshould the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week?\\n\\npeople have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.\\n\\nFirst, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.\\n\\nSecond, everyone's brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.\\n\\nFinally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.\\n\\nIn conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.                         \\n Which essay is better?

They can work on there school projects when they get home from school. But there are still are some good things that can happen if the school board add a half hour more to the school day it can give kids more time to finish there work,test,note,and projects,and they can ask the teacher for more help. But they can stay after school to ask the teacher for more help and finish all the classwork that they did int finish in class,and they can just finish there test and there note when they stay after school with a teacher.

And some the students they eat out school in if they get allergy out of the school, in the school they give different kind of food and parent think thats schools fail so maybe parents get think if there child are safety or no because there going to said its the school fail and the parent can not feel good(confident) .\\n\\nThen some of the student like or doesn like different kind of food maybe there going to hate or don't like the new menu of food because some of them there eat food for them country or regularity food on home in they eat the food in school in there are accostubred to eat the home in schools food.\\n\\nSo i think some of the students goes eat the new menu because we don't know if there going to like the food in the new menu the menu also the menu we have the students like it in they have there favorite food so maybe there not going to like the new menu in they going to decide to bring there own lunch at school.\\n\\nIn conclusion thats my three reason i think to don't change the menu we have, we just keep or have the same menu because other students' going to choose is good idea or bad idea, because some of them are accostubred for them country foods because all foods are different and some of them are not.\\n\\nI think that the students are not going to\", 'response_only': ' are different and some of them are not.\\n\\nI think that the students are not going to'}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

The journy, learning new things, and the final results of what you have mastered.\\n\\nFirst reason will be the journy. The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody.\\n\\nAs the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about \"unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow.\" You have to still keep on mastering new things in order for you to grow more. Those are my three reasons why i agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s statement. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nBased on what\\n\\nAuthor Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,\\n\\n\\'\\'Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.\"\\n\\nI would have to say that i agree with his statement because as a high school student i like to go beyond on what i already know what to do. Emerson wants yous to take another step in what we do he wants us to grow wont you? knowing that we are capable of doing something so much bigger and better and just be able to grow in are generation. Success is something that every6 high school student wants to do we want to get better at something, we want to pass are classes and if we are not willing to go beyond and put forth effort then i dont think we will be able to grow.\\n\\nHigh school is a great way to show this especially if your a student athlete; lets say that you play baseball or softball or any other type of sport that takes time to master. Playing a sport is not easy especially if you want to get a scholarship. I get ask this question all the time \"have you yet mastered being a Cather and going beyond that point to see what you have in stored?\" I have mastered the skills of a softball catcher but i know if i go beyond that point and keep practicing i know that i will be a great softball player in my years to come. Believing in your self to do something can also help you grow, just being able to say I got this and giving it all you got just gets you a step closer to becoming a master and growing into it. Another this is mistake those are alright , no one is perfect everyone is going to have there flaws and thats ok thats another way of growing and learning; won\\'t you want to go beyond something you already mastered and try something new to grow?\\n\\nEmerson wanted us to read this quote and think about what it meant to us. I ready this quote and it gets me to think \" so if i go beyond on my catching and try something else i could grow into the sport and play multiple positions on the field instead of just one.\" I could also say the same thing about JROTC in my school as being part of the drill team and going to competitions. These are good examples on what we can all think about going beyond d and farther in what we already know an athlete can do.\\n\\nI think this is a great quote and i think it is a great', 'response_only': ' athlete can do.\\n\\nI think this is a great quote and i think it is a great'}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

I think that a problem is a chance for you to do your best because you can always look back at what you did wrong and never make the same mistakes,learn from them and always do better. This is why i think that can always look back at what you did worng and never make the same mistake again, in your life your always gonna make mistakes but it will alaways give you a chance for you to realize that what you did wrong can\\'t or can be fix but you can do better from what you did before. Anyone can always say to you \"your problems could never be fix\" but you also gotta believe in yourself and say to yourself \"yes they can and i believe they can\" don\\'t let nobody make you feel bad for the problem you have or had because eveyone always has a problem even though they always look happy. Why i think that learning from them is important is becsue having a problem and you fixing it can always make you realize stuff and for you to make better choices next time. Everyone has problems in their life but that should never make you feel bad because you can always look back and think and say \"i won\\'t make the same mistake again\" also,when you have made a mistake in your life or have a problem you can always ask for help and there\\'s a lot of people in the world that can always help you out so don\\'t ever think because you have one problem it wont ever be fix because it will also, have trust in yourself and dont let other things bring you down and always think postivie of your self. You can always do better because you will realize from your mistakes and think that if you know that the mistake or problem you had was bad then you won\\'t do it again. And move on don\\'t alwyas think about the same problem you had becuase you also gotta enjoy yor life. But having probelms is something that everyone has so don\\'t think your alone because everyone has problems too so, just think positive and always ask for help. Finally, this is why i agree with that a problem is a chance for you to do your best and remeber that if you ever need help theres always people who can help you out with anything and always think postive about your self even though your going through some rough times in your life and go out and enjoy your life by doing the right thing and not making the same mistake or problem you had.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nDuke Ellington said, \" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" Do you think a problem is a good way to learn form your mistake? Learning from your mistake is a great way to know, what you did wrong, and how you can fix the problem.\\n\\nWhat does he mean by \" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\"? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don\\'t. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.\\n\\nI do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don\\'t really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn\\'t care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.\\n\\nI made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn\\'t care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job. One of my other mistake is my anger. I would always get angry but I always try to clam down because I would always take it out on people, but it won\\'t help me.\\n\\nI think that a problem is a chance for you to do your best', 'response_only': \"'t help me.\\n\\nI think that a problem is a chance for you to do your best\"}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

If you meet someone and you do something weird theyre gonna remember you as that one weird kid. it can be bad when someone have a bad impression of you when your trying to be their friend. Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you.\\n\\nif your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird. Like if your in a sport team and your that one kid who always bragging about how good they are, people around you wont want to be around you if they know your always bragging and they will spread rumors about you and people will stop talking to you if they know you like talking about yourself and people wont want to be your friend. If you wanna ask out the girl you like and she heard you did something to a another girl, shes going to have a bad impression of you and she wont even want to talk you and your tried to ask her out shes gonna reject you.\\n\\nFirst impressions are sometimes always hard to change if you dont try change it with the people you had a bad impressions with. Sometime they people you had a bad impression of are usually the people you want to be chill with. In life its best to have a good impression because it can help you through life with people you met before. Good impression have a lot of good benefits with your social life. So the next time when you meet someone new its good to have a good impression.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nIt has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so \"impossible\" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it should\\'t defined who we are. First impressions don\\'t always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking\\n\\nFirst, no one is perfect. We aren\\'t perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others don\\'t and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. That\\'s when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we can\\'t change that or let it get the best of us because we aren\\'t perfect and it\\'s okay if sometimes things don\\'t go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again.\\n\\nSecond, it should\\'t defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people don\\'t like that.

Actually challenge yourself is better because it make you insistence to do something and proud of yourself.\\n\\nSome say that people shouldn't challenge them self because they don't have to worry about the feel of disappointment from people have their reason. First ,some people may no have the determination to persistent for working on one thing,for example,I am a person that can not forces to do one thing and some time I will thing do something to beyond myself,but It's really hard to do it. Second, people scare the felling of fail and this feeling make them stop to beyond them self.\\n\\nEven thought some say that no challenge yourself is better,but I agree with that challenge yourself is better. because It make you insistence to do something.

Teachers and Students volunteer to meet those who either have difficulty in certain subjects or who want to finish their homework early.\\n\\nMy opinion is that I find it a good idea to have a homework club, because when I was in 4th grade I went to a homework club and what I did there was of course work on homework but if you finished early you could finish work from later on that day or on things that you could do on the next day and I would always rremember I would be ahead on every paper she assigned to the class because I already completed it! When I didn't do homework club I would sometimes miss fun friday because during fun friday in order to play you must have all your work done and be caught up. But when I joined homework club I haven't missed one fun friday game!\\n\\nIn conclusion I suggestion having a homework club, it help with grades and getting ahead in class! It's also very fun\\n and here is Essay B: \\nHave you ever wondered how we can somehow make homework easier? Well, I have and I'm pretty sure this could help. There are all kinds of students: the ones that do their homework on time with no problem, the ones that don't certainly do so, and the lazy ones that still do the homework, etc. There are all kinds of students and unifying them to help them do their homework for the ones that just want to do them early or those who really need the help, they are all welcomed in the club, the after school homework club. It could be the key for making all students do better!\\n\\nI personally agree on having a homework after school club. It can help anybody who needs it and I'm pretty sure students will take advantage of it. Homework is hard, sometimes easy, but most of the time is is hard and takes a lot of time. Having teachers and students others willingly would make everything more comfortable, and students could express their problems when doing the homework with no problem. Teachers will be there to teach them if needed and volunteer students will help in other things. I think every school should have this. Clubs can help at all times, and clubs like this will help lots!\\n\\nThere could be many things that could be done to make students enjoy this, and I have quite a few ideas. First of all, teachers could teach students subjects they didn't understand and help them get their homework done by explaining them. Sometimes the reason students don't turn the homework in it's because they didn't get the subject, or kind off understood but not that well. Having teachers teach them patiently could be a game changer, therefore students could stop getting answers from the internet. Another way this after school clubs could do is buying some snacks. This is an after school club so everyone is hungry! After doing all of that homework, and working hard on learning the lessons, students work hard and there should be a little reward for them!\\n\\nBelieve it or not, homework is tiring. I've heard of students that sometimes get 3 to 4 hours of homework everyday, which is just surprisingly common for some people. That's a lot of homework and students need their own lives, or to just get out of the learning area for some hours. There could be activities like going to do homework at the park, where everyone can feel more peaceful and engaged on doing homework. Students will surely appreciate if they could sometimes just be free of the school learning environment, they see that place everyday! Doing homework in new surroundings could help them feel more motivated to do things, homework could be fun to do if it's done in the right or in a fun place. Having motivation and students sharing this could make the club be more and more open on the weekends.\\n\\nI think it's important to have a club that encourages students to do homework\", 'response_only': \" the weekends.\\n\\nI think it's important to have a club that encourages students to do homework\"}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Also not being comfort with it. Because being our self is mean trust our self. Not believing to any one who come to as, and till as any thing to Change as. then reaching our goal by trusting our self. For example. Being our self shows those people how strong we can be,and continuing our way to improve.\\n\\nIn a word that we see people change accomplishment. We should trust our self to not change. To a bad person, or any thing that a society try to make as. Trusting our self and continuing our way to improve more. to show a society how strongly we trust our self.

Or a society that is Changed already, and they are following a different ways to improve their life. Also they try to change as as the way they want it. To follow their way, and we know that it is not the way we can improve. So to be our self, and we chose to improve our life in other rule.

Now working by yourself gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team.\\n\\nWorking with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what i mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you\\n\\nWorking with a group is not too bad but it can be, me as a student i do like to work with my friends but they always copying me which i do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because some times they are not even the person that did the work.\\n\\nI prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like i do not like to work with other people; that is just how i am. When i work with other people i feel like it doesn't benefits me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. It makes me feel like i can do more without having to need help from others.\\n\\nIn this world i have learned so much things, i have learned that you need to put you first, you need to think about you first, also that you need to have your own back. Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. and my answer is that you should never feel useless, you should always think about yourself. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nWhy do students like working alone? Although some students may say that working alone is more beneficial. Working in a group pushes student to gain more confidence in themselves, also has more productivity rate than working alone, and students make less mistakes while in a group.\\n\\nFirstly, working in a group has more productivity than working alone. Every time I and some of my class students have chosen to work in groups we end up finishing first. this example shows when working in a group you can attack multiple parts of the assignment. While in the other hand working alone students have to work in thing at a time showing slower productivity.\\n\\nSecondly, working alone does not push the students confidence boundaries. When i first started high school i never wanted to work in groups because i was shy and didn't have any confidence. If students can unlock confidence at a young age it will make their life easier and they will have no problem working with others.\\n\\nLastly, being in a group makes it efficient for students to spot mistakes they have made. For example every time i've decided to work alone i always made mistakes while the groups didn'r make mistakes. This demonstrates that students that work alone can't check or correct their work because they think they are right. But if students are in groups those students in the group will speak up if they think there's something incorrect.\\n\\nIn the end, I feel that working in groups is better and will benefit students in the long run than working alone. Because by the time they get to the real world students will already know how to work with others and improve their life overall.\\n Which essay is better? A or B?\\n\\nA or B is a good essay.

Honestly it is a good idea that some high school offer a program like that. They got their things done in three years. The students who do that take their time, also spend time during the summer, they dedicated more to get done their studies in a short time. Some people will think that is not fair for the others students, that graduated in four years.\\n\\nFirst, if the students wanted to finished high school early. They have ideas; otherwise, they had already thought what they wanted to be. They push themselves to another level, to get their things done, however, some of them do that to start saving money. The year that they wasn't in school, they took it to get ready for college, with the money, with the papers, they have the time to over think what they really want. I will put my cousin of example, she did that, she graduated in three years, then she got two jobs to get money for her college, she push herself to do what she really wants. Now, she's in college getting her degree as nurse.\\n\\nSecond, if all the schools offer that I know that a percent of students will be doing that. A lot of people think if they could have a chance to get graduated quickly as they can. Some of them because they want to help their families soon as possible they can. We have a lot of immigrants, they came to the country to a better life, and I know a lot of them will like to get graduated early. It is a good choice for all of them, they can help their families.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is a good chance for students, they dedicated time to graduated in three years, they push themselves to be someone with a good degree some day, some of them do that, just because they have families issues and they want to help them getting done high school early. Some of them want to get done early because in one year they have other chance to get some money, to make sure want they really want to be some day. It is a really good offer.      \\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome school districts offer students program that allow them to graduate in three years in stead of the traditional four years. All the students who follow this program are required to take courses during the summer break. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years so they will have one extra year. For example,Generic_Name will finish high school in three years. She wants to take a long career. She ants to be a doctor. However she need to go to college beteen eigth-ten . Depends how fast she finish her career,while she is going to high school. she is working after school and saving all the money she can but also she may need to apply for a scholarship.\\n\\nOn the other hand Generic_Name do not have enough money to pay his college . He will have to work a whole year after he graduate to save enough money and he will able to pay his career. Generic_Name and Generic_Name were ones of all students who took the program to graduate in three years. This program benefits then a lo. they will gradute really fast. Now Generic_Name is working a full-time. He already registered to a college who really likes him. Also is not that expensive and is not too far away from is house. Generic_Name wants to be a chef, so he may need to go o college a couple years and get a loan. Also, he have to apply for a scholarship. Generic_Name counsuler is helping him to get a scholarship.

In my opinion I think working as a group is more beneficial than doing all the work alone. I think working as a group is less stress on the student but helps get the work done faster and easier. I've noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be split between the students and not just one person doing all the work that may be hard to understand or do all the work on time. Working as a groups helps mostly those students who really don't do their work on time or having problems in understanding what to do and also they can ask the students in the group for more support or in explaining something more clear.\\n\\nFor example, if a student that is working alone doesn't understand the concept of the project and has no one to ask or just doesn't want to ask the teacher they will either do it wrong or just not do it because they don't have that extra support. In a group you usually have that person that is on top of you if you are doing you part and asking if you need help or need more explaination. Being a group creates communication skill and helps those who have trouble with interacting with other students. Working as a group get the work done faster and helps not go to hard on youself. This is why when a teacher asks me if I want to work alone or with a group or partner, I always work with someone else becasue it just helps me get my assighnment done on time because I have done big projects by myself and I see that I struggle do it , then at the end I get a bad grade or I just end up not doing it because I feel like I can ask th teacher for help. Some students have this problem in reaching out to their teacher because they are either shy or they just can't find a way to get their help.\\n\\nMany students will agree that working as a group is helpful and beneficial instead of working alone where is hard to do everything alone and having to plan what to do to get an assignment done and hoping for the best. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nWhen you see people doing their work do you sometimes think they are feeling alone doing their work. I mean the teacher ask them if they want to work with a group or do it alone but they always chose to do it alone because they don't know anyone in the class or they don't feel like working with anyone that means they wanted to look cool about it. so that would mean more work for them, What i feel that is more beneficial is working in a group.\\n\\nWhen working in a group you have less work to do because everyone has a different job to do for example, let's say you have a project and it is a group project everyone has a job to do like one person could be doing research, another person can be working on the poster/PowerPoint,and the last person can be the one presenting it to the class.\\n\\npeople could say that working alone is better and much quite, However working in a group means to making new friend and getting the work done much faster.\\n\\nWorking in a group isn't really that bad you can have some fun when you are working in a group like making new friend asking when they can stay after so you can do the project together or going to each others houses planning on what you should do with your project. But it is really fun when you are working with your friends,Working with your friends is fun because you would be laughing all day and you might or might not get some work done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have. There are some who would be focus and get the work done but there are others who would be laughing and get nothing done.\\n\\npeople would be laughing and get nothing done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have.\", 'response_only': ' would be laughing and get nothing done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have.'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Imagine the things you can get done with the right equipment. Technology allows such great effects in our lives.\\n\\nEverything is easier to get, games, books, news, and even shopping would be easier for everyone. Say your teacher wants students to read a certain book but there isn't any left in class. What would you do?. Technology will allow students to download the book and still be on task with students. Some teaches don't allow you to take the book home but with any device you can simply download the book and still be caught up with the chapter. You wouldn't be behind.\\n\\nTherefore, individuals like being updated whether it's about schools or any world news. Technology allows parent to see what's happening around them and even around the world. They don't like to miss the days news or any news. If they did, they can type the date and see what's happening. You wouldn't miss a thing! alerts will pop up on your device to inform you. Therefore, everyone stays connected to the world in any device. Technology, also allows you to stay connected with other, such as your parents and friends. Imagine having something really important to share with your friends but you don't know when you'll see them, they're just a text away. Let's say you stayed after school but forgot to tell your parents, just call them and tell them to pick you up a certain time. Information will be much easier to receive.\\n\\nHowever, some parents say technology is a waste of time but once they try it they'll get many things done. The more we use technology, the more we realize it should have been something back then and how easy things would've been. Technology is for everyone to use not only young adults. It can even be used to keep babies quiet and calm. Some find multitasking hard, but with simple devices, we can do many things at once.\\n\\nGetting things done makes people feel relieved,for getting things out of the way on to the next. It's like an endless cycle but with the technology we have now, we have much power in just our hands. It may be little power but at least we got things done in an easy matter. We may not see it now, but technology is a very positive effect on individuals.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nTechnology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Today, people prefers to interact with technology than people. They can check out books, shops, and play games without speaking to another person. Some people thinks the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have positive effects on people's lives because technology makes more easy their lives, for example they not need to leave their houses for buy or to joint with another person to play games. However, I think the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have negative effects because people prefers to shop on online than stores, people use more technology to talk, and also children plays with technology than with another person or toys.\\n\\nToday, people prefers to shop by online than stores. I saw and lived this experience many times about buy by online but I not feel comfortable as a store. Online shops makes feel lazy, alone, and when you have questions obout the product nobody can answer you. I bought by online many times but one day I understand that online shop is not healthy for me because when I go to stores I'm practicing my English vocabulary, I walk alot that means that I doing a little exercise, and meet new places and people. Shop by online avoid the human contact and gives negative effects on people's lives.\\n\\nPeople use more technology to talk, as facetime, facebook, whatssap or others applicationes.

Communication impeded in most cases by language inaccuracies.\\n\\nHere is Essay A:\\nWhen people ask for advice,it can help someone make a better choice because,it can change your thinking,it can give you a better idea,and you can know what other people are thinking.\\n\\nThe first reason it can help someone make a better choice because it can change your thinking. For example,If your thinking about something that didn't convinse you,then another person can give you an idea and it can help having a better choice. When Generic_Name was doing his project,he needed idea but he couldn't find them. So,his Dad came and help him on his project. This shows how other thinking can help our thinking.\\n\\nThe second reason why it can help someone make a better choice is because other's can give you a better idea. For example,other ideas can help you something on your project,work,or test. In the morning,Generic_Name and Generic_Name was doing there work and Generic_Name already finished his homework but Generic_Name didn't. So,Generic_Name gave her big ideas to finish you homework. This shows how even tho Generic_Name had ideas,when Generic_Name gave her big ideas then she could've understand better.\\n\\nThe third reason why it can help someone make a better choice is because people who had experience can give you ideas for your life. For example,your parent or people who has above age had went by stuff in there life. When Generic_Name was talking with his grandpa, he would always ask about what he did when he was his age. This shows how some choice that you take can help in your life.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nIf you challenge yourself, you will never become good at something you want to do or achieve it. Others believe that challenging yourself won't improve your growth. It's only going to make people struggle. Myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. That is how many people become so talented at things they do now.\\n\\nGoing beyond can raise your confidence higher. My first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. The more time I practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. After awhile, I wanted to to play a different instrument. The second instrument option for me when I began playing the flute was a violin. It was more difficult than playing the flute but eventually I got used to it. The more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth.\\n\\nSchool is a good example of improving yourself. There are specific kids who has disability in learning called Special Ed. The experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. For the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes. I've got out of self-contained classes by making so many improvements to show that I don't need to be in self-contained.\\n\\nGoing beyond can make a big difference. Going beyond the goal is a great feeling because the goal is achieved and then the on to the next level.                    \\n Which essay is better?

I believe that we our self choose our own character traits because no matter who you are influenced by you make your own decisions. Yes, there maybe others who will be in your life time their to persuade you to do bad things but its up to you if you want to stay with those kinds of people.\\n\\nFirst of all your character is something that make you,you and thats whether you choose to be good or bad, nice or mean. Their are many different types of people in the world and they have their own characters.\\n\\nSecondly all people are different and special in many ways like people could help others, they could donate their time to help the elderly, they could spend time with loved ones, or they could do bad things like stealing and other stuff like that but that all comes from you, you decide to do all those thing whether good or bad that your traits as a human being.\\n\\nLast of all people with bad and good traits can change whether you decide to or not its all up to you nobody else\\'s. People can change in many ways possible you your self just have to decide if that\\'s what you want to do.\\n\\nIn conclusion John Lubbock a British naturalist and politician said that \"your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.\" and I believe thats true. but its also true that some people some people may influence the way you act like who you grew up with, people who were role model\\'s to you, or people who motivated you in your life time. In other words I believe people choose who they want to be and how they want to act like cause its who they are it\\'s their character. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nWe choose our own character traits becouse we can choose if something affect ourself for three reasons:\\n\\nFirst, if somenthing is doesn\\'t matter for you, it will doesn\\'t affect you.

Some people when have a problem in her workplace want to resolve the problem because they are passive\\n\\nThird, if you discuss about something to someone and the person is losing the control of ennoyance, you won\\'t response back because you don\\'t want more problems. Some people when someone is losing the control of her ennoyance and want to fight, they don\\'t do anything because they are passive.\\n\\nHowever, I know sometimes it is difficult something it doesn\\'t affect ourself because sometimes it relate to family, or somenthing is really matter for us.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we choose our own character traits because we can choose if something affect ourself.\\n Which essay is better?

There is some possibility, but is going to be much hardest than befor at the first.\\n\\nFor example if you buy a house in U.S when you are start plaining this purchase you are still a joung so you have alot of effort to work hard and earn money easly to pay the purchase and get it for your own house, but if you try to buy another or a second house this will much hard for you to grow , becouse spend alot of your time and your effort making the payment for the firts house so now you dont have much possibility, you grow old.\\n\\nthe othe reason is now you have your own family, you have child, wife to pay them your attention also work for them spend your time to them the majority of the money you have. Now you dont have enough money to buy another or a second house.\\n\\nin my conclution if you try to mastering some thing that you was mastered befor can not be possible for the just reasons your human effort and other things comes down this makes you will not grow again.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nTo begin with, the people who tries something new everyday could get good opportunities. And the people who does the same rutine won\\'t be able to learn something new. The author Raph Waldo Emerson wrote a statement.\"unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow\". I have some couple reasons why i support this statement.\\n\\nFirst of all,people who get new opportunities learn something new, and grow as a person, and will help you emotionally and mentally. For example, people makes mistakes but from that mistakes we learn from it and wont do it again. learning from your mistakes can make you become a better person. Being a better person can also help other people too because they can admire you.\\n\\nSecondly,another reason why i support this statement is because if you dont try something new as a person you will never grow and become a good model for you kids. For instance, the kids that you would get can do the same thing as you and would not move foward and will live a unhappy life. For example, living an unhappy life can make you do somethings thats bad and learning something and be both good and bad. It can be good because you will always learn from your mistakes. and it can also be bad because some people don\\'t move on and they would rather take the easy road out.\\n\\nMy last reason on why i support this statement, people who try something new get to live a better life and be happy. people who live happy can influence other people to do the same thing. People who learn from there mistakes can prevent other people from also doing the same miskes you did. For example, when i was walking towards my bus stop i fell down from a spot were its slippery and i warn my sister who was also following me towards the bus stop to not step on that spot before she does the same mistakes i did. preventing other people from doing the same mistakes can help them take the right path and live a better life. helping out other people can make your feel better from your mistakes.\\n\\nMy conclution, people who learn something new are more succesful than the people who doesn\\'t . people who learn new stuff in a subject they like. know more about it than than the person who is just there regulary and does the same thing without moving on. Not moving on and learning new thing can bring you a unhappy life and a boring one too.\\n Which essay is better? A or B? __________________\\n\\nI am a student of the essay.

I truly agree with this quote because it demonstrates who you really are by doing hard work,everyone has something to give to the world and it is important for self esteem.\\n\\nBy doing a lot of hard work and not giving up, it demonstrates to people who you really are, that you are a person who is determined to get where they want to be and who preservers no matter what the chanlleges are. People may or may not agree with what want you want to do, their are always going to be someone who is going to try to bring you down emotionaly, physically or mentally but you have to show them that you are going to be yourself and do what whatever it needs to take to accomplish it. This reminds me of myself because in my senior year of High School I didn\\'t have enough credits in order to graduate that really got my family disappoint that the time I was going to an online school and it was harder for me to make up for all the classes but I saw how my own family started to put me down and it did hurt my feelings but that used that feeling to pick myself up and work everyday on the classes to be able to graduate on time. This showed people and most importantly it showed me that im capable of showing people who I really am by doing hardwork.\\n\\nI think everyone has a lot to offer to this world, you never know who will be the next person to discover a cure for a illness that people thought it was terminal. Everyone is capable of doing what there heart desires it just take determination, hard work and desire to accomplish what you want. People should not listen to what other\\'s say it only matters what you know that you can accomplish and that you believe in yourself that is all it takes to became and be where you want to be. My plans after High School is to go to college to become a ultrasound technician. I speak two languages Spanish and English and I believe because I speak two languages fluently I have something to give to the world, to the community and to any one in need. I know my own family wanted me to be a lawyer to help people with immigration lawsuits and for a while I started to consider following my parents dream of me being a lawyer to make them happy but my passion for the medical field was bigger and from my knowledge a big percent of pregnant women are Hispanic and as a person who speaks Spanish very well,I think I could help out people who don\\'t know English in order to get the resources they need.\\n\\nBeing yourself and showing the world what you are capable of shows the world that you believe in yourself and it is important for your self esteem too because it makes you feel good about yourself and most of time your going to be alone doing your own stuff, taking care of your business. You can not always depend on people to get you what you need, to get you where you want to be. I remember when I moved out of my parents house with my son and having my own room, my own space and paying bills made me feel so good about myself. I finally felt like I was doing something for myself because my parents wanted to keep me at home but I managed to get through everything and anything while living on my own and It made me more independent person and it helped me boost my energy and believe in myself.\\n\\nNevertheless, Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\". This quote has reminded that you should truly believe in yourself, be yourself, do hard work and it will motivate you to be where you want to be. I think this quote has a lot of different meanings and I think it depends on what you believe in yourself.\\n\\nI think that if you are a person who is willing', 'response_only': ' on what you believe in yourself.\\n\\nI think that if you are a person who is willing'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latino's accent trying to be cool or staff, and it's not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Because with that they're showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, that's no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention. What I want to get with that is,that they is another people who do not have atention or love and start doing things to their friend or other people start to pay them atention. Personally, I feel comfortable with the little what I have. It's not my idea be someone that I don't. And I also start to be neutral. How is it? For me, it's like if someone want to be friend, good; if people do not want to meet me, it's ok, too. Lastly, I don't care about other people, I only care about me, my 4 friends and my family, and that's it. I feel I don't need to meet more people. I'm good with what I have, because while less people I met, less people treason me. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome People Believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem,even if the work is not the students best effort. they believe that students must be self confident to learn.\\n\\nI do not, i believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too.\\n\\nIn truth I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that i started to not care as much as i used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually i came to terms with the fact that not all my work was gonna be perfect, but if i spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better.\\n\\nSo what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise.\\n\\nThe best way to actually build confidence is through achievement's,when you accomplish something and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half baked work most people get credit for.\\n\\nOnce you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your home work on time, when a test comes up you would be very well prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself.\\n\\nIn conclusion having false praise & hope is bad it lowers your standards and makes your work ethic terrible the only good way to build self-esteem is through achieving something out of hard word and dedication.\\n Which essay is better?

Having a year-round school wouldn\\'t be as bad .\"why would you say that?\" Well having a whole year of school will be more helpful. You\\'ll learn more and get as much learning as you need, and at the same time you\\'ll be getting your breaks as well. Getting this opportunity isn\\'t bad at all , plus it will benefit you later on in life once you start to go to college. School is very important especially when it comes to our future. Our education is what gets us through life , but some students don\\'t understand that .\\n\\nStudents have that ability to forget things. But yet its hard to retain that information back. They\\'re just worried more about having there breaks or when school will be over. But they don\\'t realize the benefits education has for them. They\\'ll still have there breaks no matter what. And \\'\\'yes\\'\\' we do need our breaks as well.\\n\\nWe can\\'t just be stuck in school for ever , We need our little fun with friends and family. Students will have longer winter breaks , 3-4 weeks in summer , and also have a week off in spring and fall.\\n\\nThis argument shouldn\\'t be an argument, this is something that needs to happen. This is an amazing idea, its something for the best of the students. Its giving that opportunity to the students to have the chance to learn more and also to let the students know that its not just about when the school will be over, its about our education. Because with out it, we would not be able to get through life. If we didn\\'t have this chance we wouldn\\'t get the enough education that some students need.

In my humble opinion, giving 3/4 weeks vacations in the summer to students it\\'s a great idea. First, I think it is a good idea because students would not forget what they\\'ve learned in school. For example, if they have a long summer break, they will want to be out the house the whole day and they will be focused in fun things and will forget about school.\\n\\nSecond, if the students get a longer winter break it will be beneficial for them because the weather on winter is so cold and they won\\'t feel like they are freezing while they are waiting for the bus. For example, if they walk to school they can get sick so it\\'s better to stay at home. Third, giving them a week off in the spring and fall it will help them to rest their mind.

This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a \"this is amazing\" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them.\\n\\nA great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they\\'ll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired.\\n\\nIn conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nThere are people who believe that true self-esteem comes from praising the student\\'s work and others believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement.

Those students who try their best on their work, they deserve their work to be praised, so that they can notice that the real hard work that they have done is appreciated. It would make them keep their hard work.\\n\\nThere are some people that truly believe that true self-esteem comes from achievements. It makes a lot of sense, because achievements come from real hard work. If any student achieved what they wanted, it meas that they had worked hard for it. If people want to build true self-esteem through achievements it is a great idea that they have that on mind, because it would make them feel especial if they achieve it through hard work.\\n\\nThere are many circumstances where it depends on the type of people and situation where you want to build self-esteem.

It helps the younger children with thier homework and classwork, and get thier grades up it also helps the older children understaned the younger kids.\\n\\nFirst it helps the younger children with thier homework and classwork. This is because students are getting bad grades in class. Also because they are failing the class and that will make them repete the grade or make them go to summer school. For example i went to summer school because i failed the 4th grade.\\n\\nNext they can get thier grade up. so they dont fail the grade and go to summer school. Also because they can have an A or B for the rest of the year and they will past the grade and go to the next one. For example I did all my homework and class work and got an A and B for the whole year and I went to the next grade.\\n\\nLastly it helps the older children understant the younger kids.

In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. Students get a lot of homework and tests they have to study for and need to focus on education in order to graduate from high school and get to a good collage.

For example, a high school student goes to work at a salon after school but they have so much homework and a test to be prepared for, but they have don't have enough time to study and accomplish their homeworks since their specific job is in the way. So they begin to get a low grade and fail tests, which can also give them a low self-esteem.\\n\\nStudents should not commit to a career at a young age because are still getting education.

I agree with \" Churchill\\'s statement,\" because you need to fail a less one time to get a success.\\n\\nWhen you fail many times that times that you fail gives you a success, because in more times that you fail this gives you the opportunity to be better in you life is does\\'t matter if you fail one hundred times what is matter that you learn something from the times the you fail, imagine that you fail one time and you did not learn anything from that time, when you get the second opportunity you going to fail again, because you did not pay attention in what you were wrong in the first chance, so in few words failure gives you a success when you pay attention in what you did wrong in the first time and you work in that to be better next time.\\n\\nWhen you fail you don\\'t has to loss the enthusiasm, because the enthusiasm is what makes you the person that you want to be you cannot be anything without enthusiasm this help you to do what you want to be in the future the enthusiasm that you have for something is like, when you are excite to do something you have enthusiasm is something that push you to do it. Imagine that those workers don\\'t have enthusiasm for their jobs or student do not have enthusiasm for their classes. The workers they not going to do their work correctly they going to fail and fail again in their jobs, probably because they lost the enthusiasm of their jobs or for those students that did not have enthusiasm for the classes probably they going to fail and fail over again and they not going to pass that class maybe because they don\\'t like and they lost the enthusiasm of pass that class.\\n\\nYou need to know want you want to be, because when you fail you get stronger in that thing that you fail, because if you chose a thing and you don\\'t like it normally you going to fail so to not fail you need to chose something that you like, to failure and failure without lost the enthusiasm and you really like that thing that you chose you can get a success, because you put all of your effort to do it. It does meant because you fail one time you not going to do it again you has to do it but you don\\'t need to loss the enthusiasm for that work or a thing that you chose to do it.\\n\\nIn conclusion failure gives you the opportunity to be a better person, but you don\\'t need to loss the enthusiasm because when you loss your enthusiasm makes you fail without a success when you failure and failure many times probably because you don\\'t put all of your effort.

How would his or her parents feel?\\n\\nWould home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas.\\n\\nAttending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate.\\n\\nNot only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer student's questions.\\n\\nNot only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others student's opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself.\\n\\nIn public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel? Public schools would be the best option for children. Imagine if every student went to school, their would be a positive change in their future. School can build student's knowledge everyday and to do it is by learning. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nSome schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However; the question is students would benefit from being able to attend class from home? It is seems to me that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. With out a doubt, school provides knowledge, values, and skills that will benefit students in their academic life, as well as, their social life.\\n\\nIn the first place, attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes that school offers.

Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.\\n\\nI believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.\\n\\nIn conclusion, i believe that from now on as we move forwards in life we shouldn't assume what the other person is like, and not to always rely on first impressions because they could always be wrong.\\n Which essay is better?

Some students aren't good at taking music , drama and arts classes. Some students dont want to take classes that is required to them.\\n\\nElective classes are really easy. Students will have less stress about worrying that they will fail to meet the requirement to pass their school. when the class become an elective class there will be less home work this will allow students to get an easy credit to pass the class. if this was an requirement class it would be more hard and if the students don't pass the class they will have to repeat it.\\n\\nStudents that are not good at music, drama and art will try their best to pass. but if they fail that means they have to do it over again until they pass it. But as an elective class student don't have to be good in it to pass.

The teens always trying to change there lives,looks,someone to impress,or to be popular,or other things. Teens just get influences what they see on Television,Phones and around the community. I think that we should always try to be ourselves not changing for someone or what others think about other people. What people where is what they like no person need to tell them what to wear or what to do.\\n\\nI disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote to what he wrote,that to be yourself in the world you have to constantly making something else to be the greatest accomplishment. There are different ways to be yourself in the real world. Generic_Name she is a Mexican women that had no money she lived outside no shelter nothing to eat nothing not even a job.

Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldn\\'t because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat.\\n\\nThose who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time.\\n\\nIn my opinion I think that schools shouldn\\'t allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they weren\\'t doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat.\\n\\nI think that schools shouldn\\'t allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didn\\'t study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.\\n\\nIn conclusion schools shouldn\\'t allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purpose because they will spend most of the time in social media and also they may use the cell phones for cheat.         \\n and here is Essay B: \\nLast year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.\\n\\nInitially, cellphones would draw too much of student\\'s attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn\\'t happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the \"need\" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.\\n\\nSecondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they\\'ve learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past few days would be able to find the answer and get better grades.\\n\\nThirdly, it', 'response_only': ' few days would be able to find the answer and get better grades.\\n\\nThirdly, it'}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success because it makes you strong, you learn from your mistakes, and lastly, it prepares you for excellence.\\n\\nTo begin, Failure plays an important role in our everyday life because it makes you strong.

For example, improving on your math skills can help you make a great change in your life. Failure open uncommon doors for everyone who is willing to take risks. It makes one life meaningful in many of ways trying their possible best to make it in life.\\n\\nFurthermore, failure plays an in important role in our everyday life because you learn from your mistakes. Failure helps you to forget what happened yesterday and focus on what you can do today to make success happen.

Lastly,you become wiser in every decisions you make. Being a failure makes you have a stronger believe in yourself that there\\'s a multiple chance to try again.\\n\\nSome may argue that people choose their own failure in life because they don\\'t work hard enough. They more often give up. They procrastinate when things are needed to get done. For example, people rely on others to help them get their work done without even them trying. People who encounter failure don\\'t set their priorities right choose to fail. Many of those you failure don\\'t take chances of trying again to make success happen.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Failure plays a major key in our daily life as an individual. It\\'s something helps you to develop in yourself. We all once have met failure in our life before and it\\'s the greatest power which enables us to success in life.\\n\\nFailure is the greater tool ever to improve intellectual. Fortune is made through chances of failure. Life will hit you like a kick in the stomach, but without failure, you will learn how to pick yourself back up to stand.     \\n and here is Essay B: \\nIf we think about the words that the British Prime Minister Wiston Churchill sait \" succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\" There is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I believe.

In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end.\\n\\nLes\\'t think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you.\\n\\nyou or people migth say, \" this is not for me,\" because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. That could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails you\\'re gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because I came from a coutry of Spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is English, so I remember that in the begin my English was really poor, and I just knwe a few words in English like good morning or good morning.\\n\\nI think that failure plays a major role in our everyday life because it makes', 'response_only': ' good morning.\\n\\nI think that failure plays a major role in our everyday life because it makes'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

As far as I'm concerned, I think students should select courses of study in school which will guide them toward a specific career.\\n\\nFirst of all, students who select couses that are related to career will have much more time to prepare future career. As an old saying goes:'Practice makes perfect'. Students will be able to study during high school for 3 years and it's such a long time for students to improve themselves gragually. With a sufficient preparation, students will learn about their career deeply. It's a good choice for students to build their own career goals and make it come true with enthusiasm heart.\\n\\nSecond, students select course about career will lay a solid foundation in academy study. It is benefial for students to set their foot on professional knowledge field. Also, Students can receive the knowledge what they want, and it has impact on their future will encourage them to study with passion. They may think it will feed them back in the future. Moreover, it helps students to be more competitive in applying college since the high school courses maybe connected to college couses.\\n\\nThird, it hepls students build their characters. Students can have a better understanding of society and build a sense of responsilibity during the study of career. In this view, when students are working in a company, they will have a nice behavior and apply all the knowledge they learned into the project. It's also good for country's economic, the talent people will improve the development of society.\\n\\nHowever, some people think that select the courses which are related to career will limit the students' future goals and hobbies. Even though this, selecting courses which are related to career also have many advantages. For instance, students can imrove their ability to behave professional in the future, country need talent people to run the ecomomic, college will accept the students who are good at major and so on. As the considering of students may change their mind, I recommand parents and teachers give students avaliable advice before selecting courses. It will help students to identify themselves. In addition, with their helps, students also need to considerate their future carefully since it may determines who they are going to be.\\n\\nTo put it in a nutshell, to select courses which are related to career is benefial for the development of students' future. It's like a lighthouse which lead students to a reliable path. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nDo you think students being so young can decide or choose what career they wants in their future?\\n\\nStudents should not commit to a career without having any acknowledge, when we are young we don't have really clear what we wants, as teenagers our minds change every moment, minute, or even seconds.\\n\\nFirst, new careers, I think that as the people grow up, also their minds, I think that a person sometimes can not be sure if that is the career that they wants for their future, sometimes as they are studying their mind can change as they are descovering new career maybe they find more interesting another career, for example if the person wants to be a scientist, but after he saw how engineer work now he decide to change career, now he wants to be a engineer and not scientist, just like that a person can change opinions towards something.\\n\\nSecond, bad decisons, for example that career that you choose because you saw one of you friends choosed it, you also decide to you choosed it, but now you are not really good as you friend, you friend have a good position have a good salary, but you do not have a good position as him because you don't have the skills that are good.\\n\\nThird, bad decisions, for example that career that you choose because you saw one\", 'response_only': ' good.\\n\\nThird, bad decisions, for example that career that you choose because you saw one'}\n","{'generated_text': '\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage. Communication impeded in most cases by language inaccuracies.\\n\\nHere is Essay A:\\nA positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.\\n\\nI used to be the type of person who wouldn\\'t really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn\\'t have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn\\'t want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn\\'t deserve to be treated good. The reason I said it\\'s taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn\\'t want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn\\'t have been the best. My mom is the person who\\'s always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i\\'ve always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don\\'t want to be the person who fails them.\\n\\nMost jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you\\'re doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.\\n\\nFinally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don\\'t know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself\\n\\n\"what is the point of doing all this?\". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don\\'t think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you are struggling.\\n\\nI hope this helps you in your life.\\n\\nI hope this helps', 'response_only': ' are struggling.\\n\\nI hope this helps you in your life.\\n\\nI hope this helps'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

The methods and materials thus used technology. I agree that technology has negative effects on people's lives. Technology is hurtful for all the people. For reason person learn how to get dope for the technology. Examples they used the internet to know how to get the dope from, and dope is be come unfavorable for a person. Like the person come be so wired to anyone because he doesn't know what he's doing. He be come a incorrigible person with anyone try to stop him.\\n\\nThe people don't have to go to another one house. They just use the phone to call them and ask if they don't good. Because of the technology we don't have to see each other. They think it's enough to talk in the phone or call each other video call. Before the technology everyone used to go see their family at home. Also they can go to the store and buy everything they want. After the technology they order everything online. When you play a games you don't talk to the other person that play with you.\\n\\nI think technology let you be come a unfavorable person. Reason we use technology for anything. Example you don't have to go to the bank to pay your credit bill you can sit and home and do it. You don't have to hold you debit card with you guess why because you can open it on your phone. Technology makes everything silly. Also you can pay your house bill when you sit at home.\\n\\nTechnology has a positive effects too. For reason I can call my friends in Generic_City with my phone.

It makes everything easier for us, but is it really helping or destroying us. In fact, technology help us in all sorts of ways, but it is keeping us away form each others.\\n\\nIsolating us from our family, friends, and even nature it self. Benefits from technology are huge. From just playing video games ,to buy things online; however, it is really keeping us away form each others. Technology is affecting us in all sorts of ways.\\n\\nSometimes, people separate themselves from their family, and it's all because of technology. For example, I have a cousin, who was always playing video games. All he did was that. His family was worried about him, but he never tried to get talk to them. One time his family was not at home. He called them, and realize they were at the hospital. His grandmother was dying, but he didn't even notice because he was playing video games all day long. There is another similar case. Were a friend of mines, was always locked in his bedroom. His family noticed, but thought he was just on his computer. He suicide at the age of 16, after being bullied by other students at school. Technology really keep us away from our own family.\\n\\nFriends are a big part of our family, but technology is not helping us get closer to them. For example, there was a period of my life were I play a game called Call Of Duty. I played with other people there, who I called my friends even tho I had never seen them in real life. I was isolating my self from my friends at school. When I had to sell my computer, I looked up for my friends at school, but there were some who were not there for me anymore because I kept my self away from them. Another example is when me and my friends were on a soccer team. We were on a league. There was no team who could beat us. We went to practice each Monday and Wednesday. One day a video game came out. We all started playing it. At first we just played it for an hour or two, but later on, we started to play it every day after school. All of us started missing practice because of that game. All of our families were expecting us to win the tournament, but we were not able to do it because we missed practice, so that lead us to not be as good as we used to be just because of that video game. Videotapes can ruin friendships and even a person's life.\\n\\nWe all are closing our eyes to other people and our own planet. We are not talking care as we should because of technology. One example is oceanic animals are dying because we are not recycling , and we are throwing hour trash on the ocean. A lot of fish, turtle, all kind of animals are dying because we don't focus on talking to each other, and going out to see what is going on. As long as we are good at our house with our computers or cellphones, we don't care about anything else. Another example, are new food industries. Nowadays, Food industries process our food, and make it easier for us to buy it; however most of industries don't care about nature. They just try to have the best technology, even though a lot of those machines heart our world. Nature is having the greatest impact, and we don't pay attention to it.\\n\\nIn fact, technology help us in all sorts of ways, but it is keeping us away form each others isolating us from our family, friends, and even nature it self. Families are being broken up because children isolate from their parents because their are focused on video games and other stuff. Friendships are being destroyed because nowadays most kids don't have a family.\\n\\nTechnology is not helping us in all sorts of ways. For example,\", 'response_only': ' have a family.\\n\\nTechnology is not helping us in all sorts of ways.

If your still stuck on what it even means like I was in the first few minutes of seeing that, It means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challlenge, dispite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. I dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. What im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being \"For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best\" it should be \"For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it\". Here is a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess! You\\'ll have a 1/4th chance of getting it right and if you just guess it would be bettter then sitting on the problem for 20 minutes. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nI agree what Duke Ellington\\'s said because sports, school, and family there is always a problem and a chance for you to do your best. Sports is what most of people do play a sport but we always get frustrated when the opposite team scores a point so we try our hardest to score back the point. School is what a lot of humans struggle on its our work sheets and test but every question wrong we get it makes our brain smarter so do our best and not pick the wrong answer. Family is people we love and hang out with all the time but not very often we get into problems but every time we have a problem we just have to find a solution to do our best. This is why I agree what Duke Ellington said about a problem is a chance to do your best.\\n\\nSports is fun activity we can all do but most of the people do or watch but a lot of the player or fans. Start to become angry because their opponent scored a point but. The players can solve the problem and do their best to try to get the point back. When I was ten years old i played on a soccer league my team was losing to our rivals our coach told us the problem why they keep scoring on us. The team and I fixed the problem an tried our best trying to win back again and we did win. My brother plays basketball he used to be terrible at playing basketball he missed every shot but fixed the problem by practing more and tried his best. Most of the sports have a problem but they fix it.\\n\\nSchool is a place where we make friend learn new subjects. For some people in school they struggle a lot on worksheets, test and quizzes. I used to struggle on test and quizzes but when i got the test or quiz back i studied on the questions i got wrong. So when next time I took the test i would get those questions right. So the problem i got wrong i tried my best to remember it so i would not forget it when i have the same questions on the test\\n\\nFamily are people we love and hang out with but sometimes we have problems with each other. When problems happen we try to fix our way and try our best to not have problems anymore. When I was younger I never wanted to share with my siblings. But i had to fix the problem and try my best to get the point back. I was a little bit of a loser but I was able to get the', 'response_only': ' get the point back.

Technology has made so many things possible for us humans, we took a man to the moon because of technology. But technology also, has its pros and cons. Us as humans, we're depending on technology way too much. People are buy clothes, and buying food without having to talk to another person.\\n\\nTechnology has made it so easy for people to buy things online.

Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie \"Return to the future 2\" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor.\\n\\nFirst of all, whiteout imagination the world couldn\\'t be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world.\\n\\nAlso, the imagination can help people work. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments.\\n\\nThird, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him \"i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day\", he told me he was better.\\n\\nFinally, I think and many people does is that whit out imagination we couldn live happy and whit a lot of fun, knowledge is a part of the bast world of imagination. People famous and normal people are successful by the imagination they use in theres life.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nI have been through so many things in my life and imagination has help go through the crazy thing in life. I would want to leave everything and everyone . Imagination has helped me realize that i could become who ever I wanted to be. It even helps me through any problem. It help me realize that can prove people wrong by just imagining the best things in life are coming my way. No matter how much i\\'m going through, i\\'m always going to be happy and grateful for what I have and gone through.

If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example\\n\\nSome of the students have kids and have to take care of them.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.\\n\\nAlso the family of the students can not affords the students education.\\n\\nThe person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.\\n\\nI think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.\\n\\nFirst some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.\\n\\nNext another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.\\n\\nAlso another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family.

Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families.

I am disagree with this statement because it is probable that each impression that we have is based about the things that other peoples do. Probably you can have many impression about something that you believes that is terrible but you can investigate about it and get a conclusion that is not why do you think so your impression can change, it\\'s not impossible that the impression can change.\\n\\nFirst, it is possible that we can change ours impressions when we see something that it is good or sometimes that it is bad. Sometimes we think that all the things that we see are reals but we never understand what it happening in real life. Also the first impression that we have about other person it is not great because we don\\'t know how is the person or what they want so we said bad things about them, we need to know the person first and share many things with them, later we can justify them. Sometimes the bad impressions are not good, because some peoples have problems with their health and when they know something that is so bad they have depression or other things that makes them be very sad or they don\\'t want to do anything.\\n\\nIn life we have many impression that are incredible, when we have a opportunity to get a great job, we have the best impression when we are in there, we see how is the place, the things that other peoples do, we can share with other persons and it is great, but we can change with the time because the impression that you had in the beginning it is not going the same, maybe now you have problems with your friends in the work and the impression that you have about them it is not the same. It is easy that we can change the impression that we have about the things or the person that you consider your friend.\\n\\nIn the beginning of the year I had a friend and I had the best affection about her, In my opinion she was the best friend that i had but with the time she changed, she was bad with me, she did many bad things about me, so my impression was other, I don\\'t know if other peoples think the same because my impressions changed fast when i see things that i don\\'t like it. In the same time i was thing that she was not a good friend \"why she changed with me\", i was sad because the person that a considered my friend and now is a simple person. It is weird that the impression that you had in the beginning about a person it\\'s going be the same.           \\n and here is Essay B: \\nAre first impression almost impossible to change. I agree based on my own experience they can be hard to change because when you go to looking for a job you have to have a impression. The first impression is very important to some people like if your looking for a job you try to show your best side of you. if you would just show up like you would at home they would probably think different of you and not hire you.\\n\\nWhen I started looking for a job, I told them that I was a hard working guy and that has a few experience and that would love to work for your company. While we where talking he was saying that I was good at everything they need me for the job, they ask me when can you start working i was like \"as soon as I can\" even tho it was my first job my first impression help get me a good job. those words the said made him understand that i was ready and that I was ready to work hard.\\n\\nTherefor if I showed up at the job with a really bad impression like all dirty and not all dressed up for the job, they would think that I was a bad person and that I was not good at everything', 'response_only': ' the job, they would think that I was a bad person and that I was not good at everything'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

We could help families in the community.

Us student can also do good thinks when we are doing the community service because that way un winter we can go and shovel some snow and on summer we could do other things. and doing community service its not only going outside or doing hard work you can also help some church , hospitals ,in a store and also in helping teachers and other things like babysitting. Doing community service it could also be fun it doesn't have to always be boring it could be fun because if they send you to places that you have to be with a lot of people you could be with your friend when you are doing community service like helping a teacher the teacher might need to helpers so you can ask your friend if he/she wants to go with you so you could not be by your self. community service it is also good because the way you are not always in your house trying to figure out what are you going to do because your bored or you will not be just laying down in the bed or in the sofa playing video games or watching a movie because over time that will get boring for you and it will affect your healthy so that's why its good to do community service even ones a week or in a month its not bad to do community service I do community service all Sundays and sometimes over the weekend it is so fun to do community service because i spend some times with my friends with out going to the mall or anything like that so it will be good for other student to do some community services so they can see that it is not boring to do them. so i will like to tell you principal that you should put students to do community services so they could see how good and fun it is . i will like to say that is fun to do because sometimes you are like what should i do today or what i am going to do tomorrow and you get so stress that you don't even know what to do so sometimes when you are like that and you have to do community service it would not be that hard for you to stress. you can also help your mom doing something it would be good for her to you be helping here to your dad to because sometimes your dad its tired of working and he will ask your help so you could help him and that will also can be community service because your helping your parents so that's why i thing you should put student to do the community service.\\n\\nsincerely, STUDENT_NAME\\n Which essay is better?

Although some say school should not follow four-day school week because students will not be able to learn as much as attending to school five days, actually schools should follow a four-day school week so students can have more time to rest and do homework.\\n\\nSome say schools should not follow four-day school week because students will not be able to learn as much as attending to school five days. Attending to school four days will not be enough time for teachers to go through each lesson as for students to catch them easily. For these reason, students might not be competent when having tests, homework or other assignments. I think that not following a four-day school week is a good decision because students will learn more attending five days to school.\\n\\nActually schools should follow a four-day school week so students can have more time to rest. some students join activities after school such as soccer, volleyball, basketball and others. So, some times they have practice after school where they have to be there for like two hours.

Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.\\n\\nDistance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.\\n\\nThe schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.\\n\\nIn school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.\\n\\nAt the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home. \\n and here is Essay B: \\nTake classes Online can help busy students, but is you are interested in take this classes can help you too. Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. By taken classes online they can make it easier for students to get to school, and it will help them to get to school.\\n\", 'response_only': ' it easier for students to get to school, and it will help them to get to school.\\n'}\n","{'generated_text': \"\\nYou are an essay grader comparing essays using the following rubric.\\nA high-scoring essay has native-like facility in the use of language with syntactic variety, appropriate word choice and phrases; well-controlled text organization; precise use of grammar and conventions; rare language inaccuracies that do not impede communication.\\nA low scoring essay has a limited range of familiar words or phrases loosely strung together; frequent errors in grammar (including syntax) and usage.

Almost every work or debating that they are done or still doing, it's help and it's benefit the city. There mean goal is to bring safety to the community and city. In my opinion the curfews keep teenagers out of trouble and help to teenager to be safe. I think curfews are great for teenagers, Because first it help them to be safe from night rebury. Today world we see that most rebury happen at night and it take many life and mostly teenager.\\n\\nThe new city curfews will help teenager, to keep them safe from rebury. Second, curfews help to prevent teenager, from car accident. Mostly accidents happen at nights, first it may be driver is sleepy or the driver is drunk. A government survey show that more then 70% accident happen at night, because of the driver is drunk, they driver is sleepy or driver version. This curfews help to keep teenager life safe from car accident that mostly happen at night.\\n\\nThe last one is, mostly place open at night, like bars clubs and other place. some teenagers like to go there and have fun, but the don't know how much they harm there life. When teenager go those place they are most likely to drink or smoke. When they drink they higher chance is to they become drunk and can't control there self. Mostly they don't know what they are doing, they may drive back to home,and they are drunk. They may cases an accident and it may take some one life.\\n\\nAt the end the city curfew is a thing that help our city to be safe and help to teen to be safe. It's help to reduce the accident happen every night and life taking every night in car accident and rebury. Let's support the new debating of city council to help our own son and daughter, our brother and sister,our friend to be safe. Let's all stand for this to happen.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nTeenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.\\n\\nThe curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.\\n\\nCurfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning.

We could see that why he is saying this because he is a hard working man and look at what he have done to the world, there is nothing wrong for working hard. But if we are always working and don\\'t spent time for ourselves or time with family then you could accomplish more but you will suffer a lot more for that successful.\\n\\nFor example, when we work hard and don\\'t spent time for our self or we don\\'t have any private time to relax and stop thinking about work, we will get stress and stress led to a lot of thing like can\\'t sleep at night,depressed,or maybe can\\'t eat well. So we definitely have to manage time well between work and time for yourself to maintain doing good work and have a good and healthy life. Like another scientist that work hard like Thomas Edison, his name is Albert Einstein, he work really hard but don\\'t manage time well so he have barely sleep a day. Some even said he only sleep 3 hours a day, and the consequence is he died at the age of 60 because of sickness and he even have autism when he stay awake for too long and talking to his own self. That is why we have to have free time because we don\\'t want to get stress and get tired of our work so it can led to quit job or we getting fired.\\n\\nAnother important thing is that we need to spent time well with our family too because family is where we have the most support from and also the reason why we work for so hard if we don\\'t have time for our family then they will leave us and then, by that time we gonna work and live so hard because we are lonely. And we might suicide or getting depressed and lead us to drugs. Family is what matter in our life and that is why we have to spent good time for them so they can be with us and support us when we need to so we can work harder for. I have an uncle in Generic_City, he is a successful business man, he work for a well-known medical company and and owner of a market but to pay for what he own is his time for his family. He start work at 5 a. m and go home at 11p. m and he never have time for his family. That is why during this summer his wife leave him, his daughter don\\'t wanna see him anymore because he was never there for her, and his son just never call or visit him. Now he is 40 and he is a very success person but after all of that he is still and lonely old man. This is why we need to spent time for our family because after we work so hard in our lives but we dont have family after that we are just lonely peoples that have no one to make our life happy til the rest of it.\\n\\ni think Thomas Edison quote have nothing wrong with it, and it is true that human can do so more if they are not have idle time. But if we don\\'t have those idle time we will soon face with stress, disease, depressed, loneliness and also suicide, so why we work so hard and don\\'t have free time so we die in miserable ways when we can work hard and play hard too and enjoy our life in a really good way.\\n and here is Essay B: \\nIf we are making good choses life can be more fun and easy. for Example if we are making everything correctly life can be more interesting. one way to make life more easy and more fun is to make everything correctly and think first after we want to do something.\\n\\nSometime we spend
