Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldn't because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat.\\n\\nThose who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time.\\n\\nIn my opinion I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they weren't doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat.\\n\\nI think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didn't study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.\\n\\nIn conclusion schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purpose because they will spend most of the time in social media and also they may use the cell phones for cheat.         \",\n          \"I agree that a problem is a chance for you to do your best. I think that a problem is a chance for you to do your best because you can always look back at what you did wrong and never make the same mistakes,learn from them and always do better. This is why i think that can always look back at what you did worng and never make the same mistake again, in your life your always gonna make mistakes but it will alaways give you a chance for you to realize that what you did wrong can't or can be fix but you can do better from what you did before. Anyone can always say to you \\\"your problems could never be fix\\\" but you also gotta believe in yourself and say to yourself \\\"yes they can and i believe they can\\\" don't let nobody make you feel bad for the problem you have or had because eveyone always has a problem even though they always look happy. Why i think that learning from them is important is becsue having a problem and you fixing it can always make you realize stuff and for you to make better choices next time. Everyone has problems in their life but that should never make you feel bad because you can always look back and think and say \\\"i won't make the same mistake again\\\" also,when you have made a mistake in your life or have a problem you can always ask for help and there's a lot of people in the world that can always help you out so don't ever think because you have one problem it wont ever be fix because it will also, have trust in yourself and dont let other things bring you down and always think postivie of your self. You can always do better because you will realize from your mistakes and think that if you know that the mistake or problem you had was bad then you won't do it again. And move on don't alwyas think about the same problem you had becuase you also gotta enjoy yor life. But having probelms is something that everyone has so don't think your alone because everyone has problems too so, just think positive and always ask for help. Finally, this is why i agree with that a problem is a chance for you to do your best and remeber that if you ever need help theres always people who can help you out with anything and always think postive about your self even though your going through some rough times in your life and go out and enjoy your life by doing the right thing and not making the same mistake or problem you had.\",\n          \"Seeking for multiple opinions is a good idea because you can get different ideas on what to do and what to say. I go to different adults when I have to do a project or a assignment because it helps me see what the better idea and choice to do. For example I was having trouble with my FW#6 and I asked Generic_Name for help he gave me an idea then i asked Generic_Name for help she gave me another great idea then that helped me finish my FW#6.\\n\\nAnd if you are having trouble in school and have a lot of stress you should talk to people at this school like the counselor or a teacher that you feel trusted with because it could help you get motivated and you can hear all different types of motivation to keep you happy and not stressed. Because I think that we all should talk to different people for help.\\n\\nBut also sometimes its bad to talking to a lot of people because they might tell other people about what your going through then the whole school is gonna know. But that is probably not going to happen and it would just help you take down stress.\\n\\nThats why I like talking to different people about whats going on in life and help on work because so i could bring my grade up .                                                                                                                                                                                                               \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.\\n\\nInitially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the \\\"need\\\" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.\\n\\nSecondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.\\n\\nHowever, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.\\n\\nThe student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.\",\n          \"Duke Ellington said, \\\" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\\\" Do you think a problem is a good way to learn form your mistake? Learning from your mistake is a great way to know, what you did wrong, and how you can fix the problem.\\n\\nWhat does he mean by \\\" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\\\"? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don't. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.\\n\\nI do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don't really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn't care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.\\n\\nI made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn't care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job. One of my other mistake is my anger. I would always get angry but I always try to clam down because I would always take it out on people, but it won't hurt to try to learn form your mistakes.\\n\\nEveryone can learn from their mistakes and it won't hurt to try. The benefits is knowing what to do when the mistakes happens again. Like what Duke Ellington once said, \\\"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\\\"\",\n          \"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson when he wrote, \\\"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\\\". You need to show to everyone what are your ambition to improve your life, and if you don't show to the World what you can affort, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault. You always want to know what are your own limits.\\n\\nFirst, I think what he is trying to said with \\\" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\\\" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too. That you always work hard and know your position and show to everyone how you get there, because is not easy go to the top and keep the place, and most of the people give up, and not showing us their goals complete.\\n\\nSecond, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault, ehat you did, you did thinking what its the best way for you, and don't take it like a loss, take it like you get more experience in life, and its not always happines have sadness too, but always you are getting more knowledge to know how to do that next time, and show to the world how you get there.\\n\\nThird, people always have challenging on their life that cause that people always want to know what are their limits, so they always push themselves to know what are their limits until they can't anymore. Then, they try to overpass their limits working harderst than anyone, sacrificing themselves, and living their pride to stay at the top or to go at the top.\\n\\nIn my opinion, everyone have the right to improve their life that only they need its to be more confidence then its to do not to give up and push themselves in other words being perseverance to overpass their limits thinking always in big, and leave a legacy for the next generation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"1_better\",\n
